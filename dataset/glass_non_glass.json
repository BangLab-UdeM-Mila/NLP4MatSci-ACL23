Sensitization mechanism has been analyzed theoretically through matched energy transfer processes based on the measured absorption, fluorescence spectra and calculated luminous parameters. Meanwhile, typical broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission band of Bi ions has also been obtained in present germanosilicate glass, which shifts to a longer wavelength with Ho3+ co-doped owing to the different of Bi-related active centers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy demonstrated that the addition of Ho3+ lead to the part valence conversion among the mixed-valence state of Bi. All results reveal that Bi/Ho co-doped germanosilicate glass might provide a new choice for 2.0\u00c2 \u00ce\u00bcm laser applications.",

For this purpose, a billet is forged to 10% strain at room temperature and then subjected to indirect extrusion at 200\u00c2\u00b0C. The CPF process causes the formation of a large amount of deformation twins and an increase in the dislocation density of the billet. The cold-forged AZ80 billet exhibits a higher extrusion load during extrusion than an unforged AZ80 billet, owing to the occurrence of twin-boundary hardening and enhanced strain-hardening effects in the former. The initial twins introduced by the CPF process promote dynamic recrystallization behavior during extrusion because they act as nucleation sites for recrystallization. As a result, the CPF process increases the area fraction of fine recrystallized grains and the microstructural homogeneity of the extruded alloy. The AZ80 alloy extruded after CPF shows a higher tensile strength and ductility than the AZ80 alloy extruded without CPF. The improvement in strength is attributed mainly to the decrease in the average grain size caused by an increased recrystallization fraction. The increased ductility is due to the reduced area fraction of coarse unrecrystallized grains, in which microcracks occur during tensile plastic deformation.",

The XRD analyses show that the ZnO films on SiO2/Glass substrate are poly-oriented and have a hexagonal wurtzite structure. All thin films exhibit optical transmittance of >80% in the visible range. The increase in film thickness to 270\u00c2 nm leads to growth of crystallinity and grain size to 35\u00c2 nm, increase in the transmittance and refractive indexes for both TM and TE modes, and decrease in the bandgap energy. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) exhibit UV (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc3.20\u00e2\u0080\u00933.23\u00c2 eV) and green (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc2.37\u00c2 eV) emission for all samples. However, the peaks intensity for UV emission gradually decreases which is attributed to decrease in the concentration of photo-carriers, their aggregations and larger amount of energy transfer to the down layer. Achieving the high optical transmittance of 95%, high refractive indexes and high level of crystallinity for 270\u00c2 nm ZnO films prepared by socio economic rf magnetron sputtered make it appropriate transparent conductors for waveguide applications. The excellent features of the results suggest that our systematic growth and analysis methods may establish a basis for the tunable growth of ZnO/SiO2/glass hetero-structure thin films suitable in nanophotonics particularly waveguide application.",

The glass forming ability Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 alloy has been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry. Partial Nb substitutes for Zr promote the glass forming ability. Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 BMG with diameter of 3mm can be fabricated by Cu-mold injection casting method. The glass forming ability of Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 alloy is enhanced by stabilizing the undercooled liquid against crystallization. The plastic strain up to 2.5% was obtained for Ti33Cu47Zr9Ni6Sn2Si1Nb2 BMG compared to 0.15% for Ti33Cu47Zr11Ni6Sn2Si1 BMG, which demonstrates that small amount of Nb addition can have a dramatic effect on plasticity enhancement in Ti\u00e2\u0080\u0093Cu-based BMG.

The electrochemical behaviour was tested on the cross-sectional areas of the composite rod samples in 0.5M sulphuric acid solution with up to 0.5M sodium chloride addition by potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The composition of anodically formed passive films was studied by means of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The morphology of local damages generated by a chloride-induced pitting process was examined with scanning electron microscopy. In result of those studies, a pitting mechanism is described. For both composites in chloride media, a pronounced selective dissolution of the glassy matrix phase occurs, whereas the crystalline phases are not attacked. Niobium and titanium components are beneficial in inhibiting the pitting initiation due to their participation in the passive film formation. The dissolution of the glassy matrix phase is explained by the principal higher chloride reactivity of metastable phases compared to that of stable crystalline phases and by the detected enrichment of copper in these phase regions. The chloride attack progressing along the matrix phase causes the formation of deep channels in the bulk composite material leading to an excavation and, finally, detachment of the bcc dendrites or quasicrystals, respectively. The re-passivation ability is very poor.",

Percentages of replacement of 0\u00e2\u0080\u0093100% of aggregates with fine waste glass (FWG), coarse waste glass (CWG), and fine and coarse waste glass (FCWG) were considered. Soda-lime glass used for bottles was washed and crushed to fine and coarse aggregate sizes for use in the concrete mixes. Samples were cured under 95% RH at room temperatures (20\u00e2\u0080\u009322\u00c2\u00b0C), heated in the oven to the desired temperatures, allowed to cool to ambient temperatures, and then tested for their residual compressive strength. The compressive strength of the concrete samples made with waste glass was measured at temperatures up to 700\u00c2\u00b0C. Moreover, the effect of the percentages of replacement with recycled glass on the slump values and initial and final setting time of concrete has also been measured.

In general, concretes made with 10% aggregates replacement with FWG, CWG and FCWG had better properties in the fresh and hardened states at ambient and high temperatures than those with larger replacement.

The model considers small spin clusters with infinite-range disordered couplings and short-range ferromagnetic (FE) or antiferromagnetic interactions.

Nevertheless, an infinitesimal disorder stabilizes the CSG behavior in the geometrically frustrated kagome system.

The results are used to compare the rate of material degradation among the different type of notches. Finally, it is observed that different notched geometry behave differently for quasi-static and fatigue loading. For composite component subjected to quasi-static load, the failure is mainly governed by stress concentration (local failure) i.e. the notch size is not a significant factor.

            "The effects of temperature and pressure on the ultrasonic propagation properties, dielectric constants and the Raman and Brillouin spectra in paratellurite (TeO2) were investigated with emphasis on the behavior in the vicinity of the newly-discovered, pressure-induced phase transition. The transition is found to be second-order and purely strain-induced, driven by a soft shear acoustic mode propagating along a <110\u00e3\u0080\u0089 and polarized along a (110) crystal direction. Such pure-strain transitions were previously discussed by Anderson and Blount and the transition in paratellurite is the first observation of this kind of transition. No evidence was found for any coupling of the soft mode to any other acoustic or optic mode, although small anomalies associated with lattice strains accompanying the transition were observed in some of the elastic and dielectric constants. Analysis of the effective elastic constant C, governing the soft mode velocity indicates that, within experimental uncertainty, the transition can be described by mean-field theory. Although the apparent attenuation of the soft mode increased significantly near the transition, it is concluded that this effect is probably due to the fact that the phase and group velocities are not parallel rather than to intrinsic dissipative processes in the crystal. With the exception of C44 , the remaining elastic constants and Raman-active phonon frequencies displayed normal increases with pressure. No soft Raman-active modes were observed in either phase. The static dielectric constants \u00cf\u00b51 are large, due to the large electronic polarizability of TeO2, and the anisotropy in \u00cf\u00b5 results almost entirely from the anisotropy in the optical dielectric constants \u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0088\u009e.

Temperature, pressure and uniaxial stress measurements are combined to evaluate the various contributions to the temperature and pressure dependences of \u00cf\u00b5. Combining the \u00cf\u00b5 data with available i.r. measurements demonstrated that the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is well obeyed for TeO2. Finally, the Szigetti effective charge ratios were determined for the lowest frequency IR-active modes. These ratios were found to be quite low, being 0.27 and 0.18 for the a-axis responses, respectively, indicating that the bonding is highly covalent.",

This technique has been exploited to investigate the distribution of 4f states of the rare earth metals. The spectra reflect the transitions of the N4,5 (4d) electrons to the unoccupied 4f states. These states split into a multiplet as a result of the exchange interaction between the 4f electrons and 4d holes. Multiplicity of this configuration depends upon the number of 4f electrons. A systematic study of the spectral features of rare earth series metals does not reveal any regular or orderly changes, unlike the spectra of 3d transition series metals.

Quasi-static indentation tests were conducted on a comprehensive set of scaled Quasi Isotropic (QI) S-glass/8552 epoxy and QI IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates, comparing changes in both in-plane dimensions and fully three-dimensionally scaled cases. Due to the higher thickness of the S-glass laminates, the mechanical results were normalized by a thickness scaling rule to have a fair comparison between the mechanical behaviour. The results demonstrated that the shape of the load-displacement of the S-glass/epoxy laminates is similar to that of the IM7-carbon laminates, with evident changes in rigidity appearing due to the onset and propagation of delamination and final failure caused by fibre breakage. The S-glass/8552 epoxy laminates had smaller load drops, higher deflection and higher mechanical energy absorption before failure compared to the IM7-carbon/8552 epoxy laminates. X-ray computed tomography scanning revealed that delamination is the dominant failure mode for the investigated laminates, and the shape of delamination was influenced by the ply angles at the interfaces. Comparing the glass and carbon laminates, ultrasonic C-scan results indicated similar delamination damage size for the initiation stage, however the damage size was found to be dependent on the fibre properties and layup sequence in the propagation stage.",

The purpose of the polymeric binder is to bond the individual fabric layers together during preforming prior to composite fabrication. This paper will address the significance of the binder chemistry, i.e., the compatibility of the binder with the matrix polymer, on the composite properties. The peel strength of preforms consolidated with various concentrations of binder was evaluated using the T-peel test. The highest peel resistance was obtained from preforms that have full coverage of the binder on the glass fabric. Further increase of the concentration of the binder does not change the peel strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on peel test fracture surfaces revealed mostly adhesive-type failure between binder and fiber. Double cantilever beam (DCB) and short beam shear (SBS) test results of the composite showed that the presence of about 2.6 wt% of the polyester binder reduces the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and apparent interlaminar shear strength of the S2-glass/SC-15 epoxy-amine system by about 60% and 25%, respectively. Moreover, the T g of the matrix polymer within the interlaminar region decreases about 6\u00c2\u00b0C due to the presence of the binder.

The granularity strongly influences the electromagnetic properties, especially the transport critical-current density and the magnetization. In this paper, a simple theoretical model for the granularity is introduced and then used to discuss a number of electrodynamic properties (hysteretic magnetization versus magnetic field, zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature, ac susceptibility, and flux creep with logarithmic time dependence). Special attention is drawn to the importance of distinguishing between intragranular and intergranular effects.",

            "Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is one of the wood composites which are used widely in the furniture industry. Therefore, its strengthening is required. Sandwiched material is manufactured by inserting sugarcane bagasse medium density fiberboard between the glass fiber reinforced laminates in just the same fashion as a sandwich. A hand lay-up technique is used to prepare the sandwiched specimen, in which the medium density fiberboard plate is put in between two woven layers of glass fiber epoxy laminates. Tensile and bending tests are done to investigate efficiently the tensile and flexural behaviors for the MDF strengthening process. In addition, compact tension and center notch specimen tests are carried out to obtain the effect of the modification performed for the MDF main material on fracture toughness. Moreover, a water soaking test is held out, and fungal bioassay resistance is investigated to obtain some of the novel material environments. The results illustrate that both tensile and flexural strength are extremely modified and increased. Besides, the results show compatibility and bonding between layered material and medium density fiberboard plate. The fracture toughness is greatly increased, and both tests can be met as regards fracture toughness tests for such novel composite material. The novel material has high resistance to fungal creation, which helps it to be utilized in medical furniture. Finally, it is found that only a very little percentage of absorption is established for the novel produced material.",

            "Objectives To evaluate the efficiency of immediate dentin sealing and the effects of different bonding protocols on the fracture strength of CAD/CAM occlusal veneers bonded to exposed dentin. Methods Ninety-six extracted maxillary premolars were initially divided into three main groups with 32 specimens each: without immediate dentin sealing, immediate dentin sealing/total etching and immediate dentin sealing/selective etching. Teeth were identically prepared in the dentin to receive occlusal veneers of 0.8mm thickness, milled from lithium disilicate ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD). Each main group was later subdivided, according to the pre-cementation surface etching protocol (total/selective), into two subgroups with 16 specimens each. All restorations were adhesively bonded using a resin cement (Variolink Esthetic). Half of the specimens of each subgroup were subjected to thermo-dynamic loading in a chewing simulator with 1,200,000 cycles at 10kg load. The other half and the surviving specimens were subjected to quasi-static loading until failure. Statistical analysis was performed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests. Results All specimens except one survived the artificial aging. A significantly higher fracture strength of restorations (p \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.001) was obtained when immediate dentin sealing was followed regardless of the etching method with values ranging from a minimum of 1122 \u00c2\u00b1 336N to a maximum of 1853 \u00c2\u00b1 333N. Neither the pre-cementation treatment nor the artificial aging had a statistical significant effect on the fracture strength. Significance Immediate dentin sealing protocol is recommended whenever dentin is exposed during the preparation for thin glass-ceramic occlusal veneers.",

DTA results show that the glass performs high thermal stability with the glass transition temperature of 799\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C. The interaction among rare earth ions has been discussed by adjusting the relative concentration. Er3+ ions can quench the upconversion luminescence of Tm3+ ions. Tm3+ ions play a strong role in quenching the emissions of Er3+ and Tm3+ when the content of Tm3+ ions is greater than or equal 0.05. From the view of the ratio of red emission to green emission, Tm3+ ions can improve the red emission of Er3+ ions to some extent in contrast with the green emissions of Er3+ ions. 980\u00c2 nm incident laser can be efficiently absorbed by Yb3+ ions. The relative intensity of red, green, and blue upconversion luminescence has been tuned to obtain white light. The composition with white upconversion luminescence of the color coordinate (0.291, 0.3292) has been found.

Methods Five groups of FRC with increased fiber-density were fabricated and two additional groups were prepared by adding silanated barium-silicate glass fillers (0.7\u00ce\u00bcm) to the FRC. The unidirectional E-glass fiber rovings were impregnated with light-polymerizable bisGMA-TEGDMA (50\u00e2\u0080\u009350%) resin. The fibers were pulled through a cylindrical mold with an opening diameter of 4.2mm, light cured for 40s and post-cured at elevated temperature. The cylindrical specimens (n =12) were conditioned at room temperature for 2 days before testing with the three-point bending test (Lloyd Instruments Ltd.) adapted to ISO 10477. Fiber-density was analyzed by combustion and gravimetric analyzes. Results ANOVA analysis revealed that by increasing the vol.% fraction of E-glass fibers from 51.7% to 61.7% there was a change of 27% (p <0.05) in the modulus of elasticity, 34% (p <0.05) in the toughness, and 15% (p <0.05) in the load bearing capacity, while there was only 8% (p <0.05) increase in the flexural strength although it was statistically insignificant. The addition of particulate fillers did not improve the mechanical properties. Significance This study showed that the properties of FRC could be improved by increasing fibervolume fraction. Modulus of elasticity, toughness, and load bearing capacity seem to follow the law of ratio of quantity of fibers and volume of the polymer matrix more precisely than flexural strength when high fiber-density is used.",

One major focus is the crystalline phase of TiO2, known to be the most efficient of the anatase structures. Another issue is the decoration of TiO2 with noble metals, which act as charge carrier traps for electrons. The latter hinders or reduces the electron\u00e2\u0080\u0093hole recombination rate and often leads to a more efficient photocatalytic activity. In this paper, we describe how an interlayer consisting of 3\u00e2\u0080\u00934nm silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) promotes TiO2 anatase crystallisation and has a positive effect on the photoinduced catalytic and hydrophylic properties of TiO2 thin films.

It is found that the glassy system of chalcogenides exists in the form of molecular dipoles which remain frozen at low temperatures and, as the temperature is increased, the molecules attain freedom of rotation at temperatures which are sometimes as low as 253 K. All the materials displayed dielectric dispersion in the radio frequency range. Gevers' formula has been used to calculate the dielectric loss (\u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2') and loss-angle (tan \u00ce\u00b4) from the measured values of the real part of dielectric constant (\u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2). The curves: log \u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 versus temperature, \u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 versus log \u00cf\u0089, \u00cf\u00b5\u00e2\u0080\u00b3 versus log \u00cf\u0089, tan \u00ce\u00b4 versus log \u00cf\u0089 and tan \u00ce\u00b4 versus temperature, gave a direct evidence of the existence of a Debye-type relaxation having a wide distribution of relaxation times. Cole-Cole diagrams have been used to determine the distribution parameter (\u00ce\u00b1) and the molecular relaxation time (\u00cf\u0084). The temperature dependence of \u00ce\u00b1 and \u00cf\u0084 for all the alloys is consistent with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmolecular relaxation mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The paper also reports accurate values of the static and optical dielectric constants for all the alloys. Eyring's relaxation rate equations have been used to determine the free energy of activation (\u00ce\u0094F), and enthalpy of activation (\u00ce\u0094H) for all the alloys. These results indicate the existence of a stronger intermolecular interaction for Se\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Ge\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Te alloys. mott's concept of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdangling bonds\u00e2\u0080\u009d has also been used to explain the existence of a stronger intermolecular interaction, and hence a greater density of defect states in case of Se\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Ge\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Te as compared with As\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Ge\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Te alloys.

This necessitates verifying the crack width in FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) members at service load. Recent developments in the FRP industry led to the introduction of FRP bars with different surface configurations and mechanical properties, which are expected to affect their bond performance. In the absence of test data, the design codes and guides, however, recommend bond-dependent coefficient (kb ) values considering the surface configurations. Thus, this study aims at investigating the kb values and verifying the dependency of the kb values on FRP bar type (glass [GFRP] and carbon [CFRP]), diameter, and concrete type, and strength limited to the first critical flexural-crack width.

The beams were reinforced with sand-coated GFRP bars, helically-grooved GFRP bars, and sand-coated CFRP bars and were fabricated with normal- and high-strength concretes (NSC and HSC). The measured first critical-crack widths and measured strains were used to assess the current kb values recommended in FRP design codes and guides.

A preferential orientation along (112) plane and grains with an average size of 40nm were observed for a thin film annealed at 400\u00c2\u00b0C. As the annealing temperature increased, the average transmittance in the wavelength range of 400\u00e2\u0080\u00931100nm gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 90.8% at 550\u00c2\u00b0C, where the highest optical band gap of 3.98eV was obtained.

The use of fibers increases the ductility of the cementitious matrix and limits the crack widths upon loading. This is advantageous in terms of autogenous healing. This healing can be further promoted by the use of superabsorbent polymers. The combination of translucency using glass fibers with promoted self-healing properties using superabsorbent polymers was therefore assessed using a direct-mixing technique. The mixture composition was optimized, the translucent property was available, multiple cracking was achieved, cracks were able to visually close and the mechanical properties were regained.

SEM micrographs of the joints showed the formation of FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers at the interface. The formation mechanism was that the elements Fe and Ti reacted with [BiO6] units and came out as needle-like FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers during cooling when the Ti content in the seam reached the critical concentration of crystallization. The quantity and morphology of the FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers could be controlled by adjusting the bonding temperature and applied pressure, which could decide the Ti content in the seam. The deciduous ferrite ceramic particles were observed at the interface due to the formation of the FeBi5Ti3O15 whiskers continually consumed the elements Fe and Ti. Under the combined influence of the elements diffusion and interfacial reactions, nearly defect-free joints were obtained and a maximum in the shear strength of 92MPa was achieved at 750\u00c2\u00b0C for 30min under 100Pa applied pressure.",

The results show that a small amount of MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics can make their microstructure become denser and more uniform and MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics, as a grain growth inhibitor, has an evident effect on the reduction of grain sizes. The Mn ions exist in the form of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in the SBN-glass-ceramics, as confirmed by XPS measurements and Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions easily form charge defect complexes, which causes the leakage current densities of the SBN-glass-ceramics to obviously decrease. And a small amount of MnO2 doping of the SBN-glass-ceramics can effectively decrease the dielectric loss of the materials.

            "Gold-patterned glass substrates sealed to a PDMS fluidic layer is an architecture widely employed in microfluidic devices. The plasma bonding method is commonly used but presents the disadvantage of being ineffective on gold surfaces, creating a sealing weakness where solution leakage can be a problem. Frequently, alternative approaches to sealing include additional patterned layers that often require expensive cleanroom time. Here we demonstrate a sealing method involving carboxyl-terminated and amine-terminated silanes appropriate for PDMS-based device fabrication with patterned gold/glass surfaces. This cleanroom-free methodology improves solution leak pressure 37-fold compared to the standard plasma bonding technique on these patterned substrates. This bonding strategy is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept electrochemical cell enclosed in a PDMS chamber. An electrochemical method for preparing a clean and electroanalytically useful gold surface in the PDMS device is detailed.",

Vacuum brazing using these ribbons were done to join two plates of Ti alloy at 990 K for a period of 10 min. The main aim of the present work was to study the use of the metallic glass ribbons as brazing material for titanium based alloys. Since the microstructure during crystallization of these metallic glasses is expected to influence the strength of brazing joints, microstructure characterization is very important. Here we present the results of characterization of the ribbons with Ti20Zr20Cu50Ni10 composition as well as the brazed sample after joining two Ti-plates. Both as-spun and heat-treated ribbon were characterized by X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to both TEM and FESEM.

            "Previous studies have well demonstrated that recycled glass (RG) can be incorporated into cementitious materials to replace 100% river sand as fine aggregates. However, this replacement was found to incur adverse effects on the mechanical properties of the cement mortar. In this study, CO2 curing was employed to ameliorate these drawbacks. The effect of CO2 curing on both of the mechanical properties and microstructure of the RG incorporated cement mortar was studied by a series of laboratory tests. The results showed that replacement of river sand by 100% RG led to a 37% decrease in compressive strength and a 32% reduction in flexural strength of the mortar samples under conventional curing. Whereas, CO2 curing of these samples significantly enhanced both the compressive and flexural strength, with a more pronounced improvement on the former. Such improvements were further reflected by a decrease in both the water absorption and porosity, and by an enhancement of the microstructure. This is attributed to the fact that compared with the mortar samples prepared with 100% river sand, those prepared with 100% RG had a more porous structure due to the smooth surface of RG and thus a poor bonding between the RG and the cement paste. However, such a porous structure encouraged CO2 gas to penetrate and diffuse more easily into the cementitious matrix, resulting in a higher degree of CO2 curing.",

            "Theoretical estimates and experimental data indicate that the new high Tc Oxides have an extremely short coherence length, of the order of the size of the unit cell. In contrast with the formerly known superconductors, this short coherence length gives rise to a new behavior of the superconducting order parameter, including large thermodynamic fluctuations in the vicinity of Tc and a strongly enhanced sensitivity to local defects. In particular, the order parameter is strongly depressed at the boundaries, including external surfaces and internal planar defects such as twin boundaries. This depression is most pronounced at high temperatures where the coherence length becomes larger than the extrapolation length. The boundaries act effectively as pair breaker, leading to a smeared density of states, suppressed surface superconductivity, reduced critical densities and to the glassy behavior for which there is considerable experimental evidence. The latter may be understood as resulting from the existence of an irregular network of internal Josephson junctions located at twin boundaries or other planar defects. Recent experiments pointing out to a quantitative correlation between twin boundaries density and superconducting properties will be reviewed.",

Due to the strong interaction between H3PW12O40\u00c2\u00b7nH2O and TiO2, the passivated TiO2 mesoporous electron transport layer (hereafter denoted as PW12/TiO2) with an optimal weight ratio shows a more uniform coverage on the underlying substrate in comparison with the bare TiO2. Furthermore, the resulted PW12/TiO2 also shows an obviously improved conductivity and significantly increased photoluminescence quenching for the perovskite emission. Thereby, this strategy leads to an apparently improved photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency enhancement from 15.05% to 18.20%. In conclusion, our present study provides an effective approach for further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells by passivating the mesoporous electron transport layer with the well-known heteropolyacids.",

The relevance of the various temperatures is discussed on the basis of dynamic light scattering studies and dielectric relaxation data. The dynamic and static light scattering experiments revealed some unexpected features, which cannot be explained on the basis of conventional liquid state theories: (1) In static light scattering the intensity I(q\u00e2\u0086\u00920) is no longer proportional to the isothermal compressibility. (2) This excess scattering I exc shows a strong q-dependence (q = (4\u00cf\u0080n/\u00ce\u00bb)sin(\u00ce\u00b8/2)) corresponding to a correlation length \u00ce\u00be in the range of 20\u00e2\u0080\u0093200 nm.

The study reveals the impact of the oxygen content of the powder, the process atmosphere and the temperature of the substrate plate on the structural and mechanical properties of the processed material. For clarifying the causes and mechanisms for the formation of defects in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM, the samples were examined by x-ray, scanning and transmission electron microscopy including elemental distribution maps and crystallographic analyses by electron backscatter diffraction. Impurities, mainly oxygen, were identified as cause for the predominant defect structure comprising cracks and residual porosity. During processing, oxygen in the form of molybdenum/tungsten oxide, segregates at the grain boundaries, thereby inducing hot cracking. This is due to the lower melting point of the eutectic compared to the matrix phase. Moreover, the oxygen impurities were found to weaken the grain boundaries and thus increasing the risk for cold cracking and leading to a higher Ductile-to-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Subsequently, the combination of cracks through hot cracking at planar solidified grain boundaries and cold cracking along weakened grain boundaries during rapid cooling from the melting point creates the crack network generally found in molybdenum and tungsten processed by SLM.

The effects of Ar gas pressure on the structural, optical, and electrical properties were investigated. As the Ar gas pressure increased, the resistivities of the AZO thin films increased, the mobilities decreased, and the carrier concentrations were constant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that higher Ar gas pressures promoted O\u00e2\u0080\u0093Zn bond formation and reduced the number of oxygen vacancies. The reduction in mobility, which increased the resistivity, was attributed to increased lattice scattering by the oxygen atoms.

Most glass fibers are industrially sized by a smooth layer of polymer-based coating causing poor adhesion between fibers and the matrix. This study examined oxygen plasma etching of glass fibers sized by aminosilane. Modified fibers were observed using SEM microscopy to reveal changes in their morphologies. Chemical changes were detected using contact angle measurement with samples wetted by water. To reveal the interaction between fibers and the matrix, mechanical destructive tests were conducted on prismatic fiber-reinforced mortar samples. Sized fiber surfaces were slightly roughened and activated. Loading tests revealed that bending and the compressive strength of lime-based mortars reinforced with treated fibers performed more poorly than those with reference fibers.",

Three different ratios of rice husk ash namely 2.5%, 5%, and 10% are added to obtain three TBCMs as well as conventional cement mortar CM (zero % of rice husk ash). The specimens of all mortars are cured under tap water for different periods of time namely 3, 7, 28, 60, and 90 days. The influence of amorphous silica present in both waste glass and rice husk ash on the performance of TBCMs is studied. The results emphasized that both the waste glass and rice husk ash has a positive effect in the improvement of the compressive strength values of all mortar specimens with increasing hydration time. While the physical parameters such as total porosity and water absorption percentages decreased. The results also indicated that for any given hydration time, the compressive strength values of TBCMs are higher than those of CM. The noticeable improvement in the compressive strength is for TBCM2 specimens (5% rice husk ash). On the other hand, the influence of gamma-irradiation doses on physico-mechanical properties of unsaturated polyester (UP)/impregnated blended cement mortar composite specimens (TBCMs) is studied.

A supersaturated solid solution of all the alloying elements in Fe has formed in the initial stages of milling. This \u00ce\u00b1-Fe phase became amorphous on subsequent milling up to 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330h. Further milling, unexpectedly, led to primary crystallization of the amorphous phase resulting in the formation of an (\u00ce\u00b1-Fe)\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 phase with a slightly smaller lattice parameter (and lower solute content) than that in the early stages of milling. External annealing of the amorphous phase powder at 700\u00c2\u00b0C for 1h led to complete crystallization of the amorphous phase into a mixture of phases including \u00ce\u00b1-Fe, ZrFe2, Fe2B, Fe3B, MoB2, FeMo2B2, and at least another unidentified phase.

Light-cured resin-modified glass ionomer cements have recently become available, but a lack of information exists regarding their radiopacity. Purpose of study. In this study the radiopacity of glass ionomer cements was assessed with a standard method that related densitometric measurements to an equivalent thickness of aluminum. Material and methods. Radiographs were made of specimens with seven materials commonly used as liners and bases: two reinforced zinc oxide\u00e2\u0080\u0093eugenol cements (Kalzinol and Intermediate Restorative Material, De Trey Dentsply), a zinc phosphate cement (SS White, S.S.

The radiopacity of all materials was compared with dentin. Results. Kalzinol had the greatest radiopacity of the materials tested. The glass ionomer cements were substantially less radiopaque than other materials. The conventional glass ionomer cement, Ketac-Bond, was more radiopaque than the three resin-modified glass ionomer cements.

The structure of these samples was examined via X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The developed dual-phase structure alloys combine the high strength of glassy alloys and plasticity of crystalline alloys. Plastic deformation was enhanced by this dual-phase structure. Mechanical characterization of the alloys revealed three deformation stages, namely a martensitic transformation, dislocation slip in a crystalline phase, and shear deformation of the glassy matrix. Two types of effects involving the martensitic transformation were observed: superelastic behavior and the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect, which provide an additional deformation mechanism and lead to a significant increase in the plasticity of these dual-phase samples. The results indicate that the fraction of glassy phase occurring in large rods formed at lower cooling rates is lower than that occurring in smaller rods; therefore, the deformation-induced martensitic transformation of the crystalline cP2 phase in the large samples occurs at lower stresses.",

The null hypothesis tested was that fracture resistance and the failure pattern of these teeth were not affected by the use of FRC posts or by the type of full-coverage crown. One hundred twenty maxillary incisors were endodontically treated and divided into 4 groups of 30 each. Each group was divided into two subgroups: restoration with or without fiber post. PFM crowns were placed in group 1, Empress II crowns in group 2, SR Adoro crowns in group 3, and Cercon crowns in group 4. Fracture tests were performed by loading specimens to fracture. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (\u00ce\u00b1 = 0.05). The type of crown was not a significant factor affecting fracture resistance (p = 0.4), whereas the presence of a post was (p = 0.001). Both the presence of post and the type of crown had a significant influence on the proportion of restorable versus unrestorable fractures. Although prosthodontics textbooks do not generally advocate the placement of fiber posts in endodontically treated incisors, the results of this study indicate that the use of fiber posts in such teeth increases their resistance to fracture and improves the prognosis in case of fracture.",

Fatigue tests were conducted on both [(0/90)3] and [(\u00c2\u00b145)3] stacking sequences. In order to analyze the influence of moisture content on the fatigue behaviour, samples were conditioned at RH0, RH50 and RH100. Although moisture content affects the fatigue life for high stress levels, this effect tends to disappear for low stress levels. This phenomenon was confirmed by additional fatigue tests in a climatic chamber. This paper aims to investigate damage mechanisms developing within the material during fatigue test in order to understand the origin of this phenomenon. Two in-situ non-destructive techniques were used in order to detail the fatigue damage scenario: namely, acoustic emission and infrared thermography. These techniques allow locating and differentiating the main damage mechanisms: matrix cracking, fibre/matrix debonding and fibre breakages. In addition, microscopic observations and synchrotron X-ray microtomography were realized on fatigue coupons to visualize fibre breakages. Results have highlighted an increase in the amount of fibre breakage when the applied fatigue stress decreases, which explains the observed phenomenon.",

            "The effect of Mg content (2.5 and 7.5\u00c2 wt%) on the development of centrifugally cast in-situ A356-Mg2Si composite functionally graded material (FGM) has been investigated. The secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) has the effect on size and volume% of Mg2Si particles. FGMs are characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, measurement of hardness and room and elevated temperature tensile properties (UTS). The microstructural features are correlated with room temperature and high temperature tensile properties at 150\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C and 300\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C. Since the population of Mg2Si particles are maximum at inner zones, the tensile strengths at these zones are maximum among the three zones. The room temperature tensile strength of FGM with 7.5\u00c2 wt% Mg shows maximum value however it decreases at higher temperatures. The peak UTS of both FG composites in all three zones are attained at around 150\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C. Maximum peak UTS of 178\u00c2 MPa is obtained with A356\u00e2\u0080\u00932.5%Mg at this temperature. As the test temperature is increased, the fracture mode is changed from mixed mode to ductile mode. Particle cracking and decohesion of particles from the softer matrix are responsible for these two modes respectively.",

First, the fiber-reinforced PA12 composite tensile samples and lattice structures were prepared by selective laser sintering (SLS). Then the tensile experiments were carried out on the tensile samples, and the tensile strength and elastic modulus were obtained. Moreover, the compressive experiments were carried out on the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures. The full field displacements and strains were obtained using DIC, and the failure position and failure mode can be captured from the strain fields. The repetitive energy absorption property of the lattice structures was comparative analyzed between the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures with and without fiber-reinforcements. The experimental results show that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the 3D printed PA12 composites with fiber-reinforcements are higher than that without fiber-reinforcements. The compressive strength of the 3D printed PA12 composite lattice structures with fiber-reinforcements are lower than that without fiber-reinforcements, but the repetitive energy absorption property of the 3D printed PA12 composites lattice structures with fiber-reinforcements are more stable than that without fiber-reinforcements.",

The kinetic parameters, activation energy for crystallization (Ec ) and Avrami exponent (n), were evaluated under non-isothermal conditions using the results obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) performed at different heating rates. DTA curves exhibited two overlapping exothermic peaks associated with the crystallization of the glass. Barium borate (BaB4O7) was the first crystalline phase to be formed and it was followed by the formation of barium zinc silicate (BaZnSiO4), as identified by XRD. For the first exothermic peak, when the fraction of crystallization (\u00cf\u0087) increased from 0.1 to 0.9, the local activation energy (Ec (\u00cf\u0087)) decreased from 700 to 500kJ/mol, while for the second exothermic peak, Ec (\u00cf\u0087) slightly increased from 490 to 570kJ/mol. For the range of 0.1< \u00cf\u0087 <0.9, the local Avrami exponent (n(\u00cf\u0087)) increased from \u00e2\u0088\u00bc1 to 1.4 for the first exothermic peak and it decreased from \u00e2\u0088\u00bc1.7 to 1.4 for the second exothermic peak. Observation by SEM of the microstructure of sintered glass samples revealed that crystallization started at the surface of glass particles, with growth of lamellar crystallites, that together with some quasi-spherical nano-sized crystallites progressed towards the inside of the glass at the highest sintering temperatures. The change of the local activation energy with the fraction of crystallization suggested that a multi-step kinetic reaction took place during sintering and crystallization of the glass.",

The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate showed low ability to withstand heat treatment during the annealing process, leading to an increase in sheet resistance. The heat stability of ITO conducting glass was greatly improved by depositing metal oxide, such as antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), aluminium-doped zinc oxide, and SnO2, on the ITO layer. The cell made from mesoporous-assembled TiO2 nanocrystal (MP-TiO2) showed the higher cell efficiency (6.5%) than that made from commercially available P25 TiO2 powders (5.6%). A high short-circuit current of MP-TiO2 cell (13.2\u00c2 mA/cm2) could be due to pure anatase phase content and high surface area of the mesoporous-assembled TiO2 nanocrystal. The addition of commercially available TiO2 powders in MP-TiO2 improved the cell efficiency (7.2%) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra of the cell due to the increase in the light scattering ability of the agglomerated particles of commercially available TiO2. The efficiency of cells using double-layered ITO/ATO and ITO/SnO2 substrates was higher than that of the cells using single-layered ITO substrate. Among various conducting glasses, the cell made from ITO/SnO2 showed the highest efficiency. The heat stability of ITO substrate can be improved by increasing the film thickness of SnO2, with SnO2 layer thickness of 100\u00c2 nm exhibiting the highest cell efficiency in this study (7.2%).

The effects of common wood preservative treatments on the durability of wood and E-glass/phenolic pultruded sheet interfaces and wood/wood interfaces was studied through a standard accelerated cyclic exposure test method. Pre-treatment of individual wood laminations with oil-borne (copper naphthanate, pentachlorophenol and creosote) and water-borne (CCA and CDDC) preservatives increased the delamination between the wood and FRP composite reinforcement with respect to untreated control samples. Post-treatments of wood/FRP composite laminated beams with the same preservative systems had more limited effects than pre-treatments on delamination.

The shift of the abnormal peak towards low temperature with the field increases, magnetic relaxation experiment and the training effect confirm the freezing spin glass characteristic. The broadening of the freezing peak in higher field can be well explained by the reduction of short-range magnetic correlation length. Due to the competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, obvious exchange bias effect was observed.",

Ab initio studies of these structures are practically absent due to difficulties in handling simultaneously atomic and magnetic ordering effects in disordered alloys. In this work we use the generalized perturbation method (GPM) A.V.Ruban, S. Shallcross, S.I. Simak H.L. Skriver, Phys. Rev. B 70 (2004) 125115 in the framework of the KKR method and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) in order to determine both effective chemical interactions and magnetic exchange interaction parameters of the classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian in Cu\u00e2\u0080\u0093Mn alloys. The effective chemical interactions have been used in Ising Monte Carlo simulations to determine the equilibrium distribution of atoms on the FCC lattice at the experimental aging temperatures. The obtained atomic short-range order for Cu\u00e2\u0080\u0093Mn alloys is in excellent agreement with the existing experimental data. The underlying atomic distribution has subsequently been used in Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations with the exchange interaction parameters calculated for the corresponding alloy composition by the GPM method.

The substrates: glass and PET were activated in piranha and potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, respectively. The activated substrates were then functionalized with 11-(triethoxysilyl)undecanal (TESUD) using structured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps and transferred by \u00ce\u00bcCP. After printing, the PPy was grown onto the silane patterned surface using electroless polymerization. The printed patterns were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results have shown that PPy rings can be developed and were well-defined onto glass and PET substrates through \u00ce\u00bcCP and electroless polymerization. The PPy was grown to dimensions of an inner ring diameter (IRD) of 50, 30 and 20\u00ce\u00bcm and an outer ring diameter (ORD) of 30, 20 and 10\u00ce\u00bcm, respectively.

We show that this deficiency can be overcome by infiltrating the zirconia cementation surface with glass. Current methods for assessing the fracture resistance of resin-ceramic bonds are marred by uneven stress distribution at the interface, which may result in erroneous interfacial fracture resistance values. We have applied a wedge-loaded double-cantilever-beam testing approach to accurately measure the interfacial fracture resistance of adhesively bonded zirconia-based restorative materials. Methods The interfacial fracture energy G C was determined for adhesively bonded zirconia, graded zirconia and feldspathic ceramic bars. The bonding surfaces were subjected to sandblasting or acid etching treatments. Baseline G C was measured for bonded specimens subjected to 7 days hydration at 37\u00c2\u00b0C. Long-term G C was determined for specimens exposed to 20,000 thermal cycles between 5 and 55\u00c2\u00b0C followed by 2-month aging at 37\u00c2\u00b0C in water.

Results The baseline and long-term G C for graded zirconia was 2\u00e2\u0080\u00933 and 8 times greater than that for zirconia, respectively. More significantly, both the baseline and long-term G C of graded zirconia were similar to those for feldspathic ceramic.

G C for the graded zirconia was as large as for feldspathic ceramic, making it an attractive material for use in dentistry.",

The photoluminescence characteristics of the prepared glasses were explored and the efficient energy transfer between Tb3+ ions and Eu3+ ions under 484nm excitation was confirmed using excitation and emission spectra. The photoluminescence and lifetime measurements reveal the efficient energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ through quadrupole\u00e2\u0080\u0093quadrupole interaction between the rare earth ions. The important energy transfer parameters such as energy transfer probability and transfer efficiency were computed. The energy transfer efficiency was considerably increased with an increase in the concentration of Eu3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity analysis revealed that the as obtained glassy system exhibits a greenish-orange emission with a low concentration of Eu3+ ions and can be tuned to orange-red emission by increasing the concentration of Eu3+ ions. The obtained results suggest that the prepared glassy system has potential applications in various optoelectronic devices.",

With the incorporation of SGF into ternary SGF/rubber/PET blends, the resulting blends may possess attractive tensile and impact characteristics. From this research, it was observed that SGF is effective in improving the tensile modulus, tensile strength and notched impact strength in the SGF/PET binary blends. However, the presence of MA-g-SEBS rubber in the SGF/rubber/PET blends did not improve the notched impact strength, while the tensile properties were adversely affected. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination observed that in the ternary blends, a layer of MA-g-SEBS/PET matrix was coated onto the glass fibres. These coatings reduced the interfacial shear strength between the fibre and matrix, which gave rise to the severe reduction in tensile strength with increasing rubber content.",

Composite tubes with three different fiber fabric layers were considered to study the influence of polyurethane foam on the crushing performance. Also, effects of different geometrical characteristics on energy absorption by different tubes are studied. Experimental results show that the presence of polyurethane foam inside the composite tubes suppresses the circumferential delimitation process and fiber fracturing; consequently, it increases the specific absorbed energy by the composite tubes during the flattening process. Also, it is resulted that injection of the polyurethane foam in the tubes causes the more regular deformation mode, comparing with the empty tubes.

The Sc(III) ion is more resistant to a cooperative, static ordering of the Mn(III) e-orbitals than is Ga(III); the Al(III) ion is less resistant than Ga(III). The data for these insulators confirm the existence of a ferromagnetic vibronic-superexchange interaction between octahedral-site, high-spin Mn(III) with fluctuating e-orbitals and stabilization by an applied magnetic field of the orbitally disordered, ferromagnetic phase relative to the orbitally ordered antiferromagnetic phase. A similar spin-glass to ferromagnet transition in the mixed-valent La1\u00e2\u0088\u0092x SrxMnO3 system at compositions exhibiting the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon supports the coexistence of ferromagnetic vibronic-superexchange and double-exchange interactions in the ferromagnetic phase and correlation bags rather than conventional magnetic polarons in the paramagnetic phase of the CMR manganites.",

            "The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of intra-ply hybrid patches based on glass and Kevlar woven fabrics on the local bending response of adhesive bonded external patch repairs in damaged glass/epoxy composite laminates. In intra ply hybrid patches glass and Kevlar fibre reinforcements are combined in the same layer. The intention, in using these hybrid patches, is to combine the excellent mechanical properties of glass fiber as a brittle reinforcement with the superior high elongation to failure property of Kevlar fiber as a ductile reinforcement. Five different kinds of plain weave woven fabrics with different ratios between glass and Kevlar fibers (100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100) were used as the external patches. The undamaged virgin specimens were taken as a reference for the comparison of residual mechanical properties. Multiple quasi-static indentation tests were carried out on repaired glass/epoxy specimens, and their ultimate indentation load, stiffness and permanent deformation were estimated. Failure mechanisms of repaired glass/epoxy specimens under indentation loads were investigated using online Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring technique. The indentation loads required for the occurrence of various failure modes were measured to illustrate the chronology of progression of different damage modes with increasing load and the kinetics of the various damage modes individually defined in real time. The use of different hybrid patches had a significant effect on the local bending response of the repaired glass/epoxy specimens. In practice, specimens repaired with patches including equal volume fraction of glass and Kevlar fibers presented a more favorable indentation response than virgin ones and other repaired specimens by exhibiting balanced mechanical properties (i.e., high deflection to ultimate failure associated with superior patch-parent laminate bond strength).",

However, the long-term resistance of these materials to physical degradation in the humid oral condition is not known. The objective of this investigation was to determine the mechanical properties, e.g., ultimate compressive strength and diametral tensile strength, of several glass ionomer materials as a function of time after aging in water at oral temperature. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Methods. Eight glass ionomer filling materials indicated for restorative or core build-up applications were studied. Three conventional glass ionomers, two metal-containing conventional glass ionomers and three methacrylate-modified systems were included in the study. Cured specimens of each were aged in distilled water at 37\u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h, 1 wk, 4 wk, 12 wk, 24 wk and 52 wk. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Results. Like the conventional glass ionomers, the methacrylate-modified glass ionomers of this study, with one exception, did not exhibit a decrease in compressive strength, modulus and diametral tensile strength as a result of prolonged storage in water at oral temperature. Some differences among the various groups were apparent. The compressive strengths of the conventional glass ionomers were lower than the methacrylate-modified system, except for one material, Fuji II (GC Dental Corp.), of the former group. A significant difference in the compressive strength was seen between the encapsulated and hand-mixed versions of the same commercial brand product. The compressive modulus was higher and the diametral tensile strength was lower for the conventional systems indicating that, as a group, these materials are more brittle than the methacrylate-modified hybrid ionomers. With the exception of VariGlass VLC (L.D. Caulk), most of the materials studied showed little decrease in mechanical properties after aging in water for 52 wk. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Significance. These materials could, therefore, be indicated for use in applications where they are in contact with oral fluids under physiological conditions.",

The cementitious mortar was developed with fine aggregate partially replaced by varying percentage fly ash and compressive strength was evaluated. The optimum compressive strength and tensile strength was obtained at fly ash replacement percentage of 60% of the fine aggregate. Tensile strength of glass fibre TRM laminates was evaluated for different thickness of the laminate. The strength and stiffness of TRM specimens increases as the percentage fine aggregate replacement increases. As the thickness of the TRM specimens increases, the tensile capacity increases linearly up to 10\u00e2\u0080\u00afmm thickness, beyond which the rate of tensile strength development decreases.",

Transition selection rules and intensities can be easily treated if one symmetric top function is dominant in the combinations (near-symmetric top limits). In this case, a spectrum is rather similar to that of a symmetric top, but line splitting occurs, due to the breakdown of the degeneracy of pairs of levels with the same value of |k| (asymmetry splitting). For large asymmetry, the symmetry properties of a rotational state can be found by its correlation with the two symmetric top limits. This allows one to find selection rules in the parities of the limit quantum numbers ka and kc . Special selection rules for the most intense transition lines are also discussed.",

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the powders showed transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline phase at 800K. Magnetic evaluation of the bulk glassy cores revealed best soft magnetic property at a sintering temperature of 775K which was due to the formation of \u00ce\u00b1-Fe(Si,Al) and Fe3(Si,Al) nanoparticles evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray analysis. However, at this temperature the glassy compact exhibited low value of remanence, which was attributed to the demagnetization field due to porosity in the material that developed from the escaped mineral binder. At subsequent higher sintering temperature of 785K the glassy core exhibited inferior soft magnetic properties with a low coercivity due to the formation of strongly anisotropic boride phases. Remanence value increased due to reduced demagnetization effect arising from a more compact morphology. Such reduced porosity was due to the coalescence of powder particle as observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",

Furthermore, fibers enhance the tensile strength and slightly reduce the compressive strength of the concrete. Glass and fibers in concrete reduce slump.

Three different mix designs were regulated by the ACI method (fc28 =21, 28, and 35MPa) with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% LCD glass sand replacements investigated; their engineering properties were determined. Test results revealed that, when compared to the design slump of 15cm, the 20% glass sand concrete for the three different mix designs kept good slump and slump flow. Furthermore, a slump loss ranging from 7 to 11cm was observed for specimens with 60% and 80% glass sand replacement for the design strengths of 28 and 35MPa. The compressive strengths of the concrete with glass sand replacement were higher than the design strengths. Moreover, the durability of the concrete with 20% glass sand replacement was better than that of the control group. Surface resistivity for specimens with different amounts of LCD glass sand replacement was also higher than that in the control group for mid to long curing ages. The sulfate attack in concrete with different amounts of glass sand replacement caused less weight loss than in the control group. Moderate chloride ion penetration was observed for glass sand concrete. Furthermore, the measured ultrasonic pulse velocities for LCD glass sand concrete specimens were higher than 4100m/s, which qualified these specimens as good concrete.

Copper mold casting and melt-spinning methods have been applied to study the influence of the cooling rate on the properties of both alloys, Ti75Zr10Si15 and Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15. As a result of different cooling rates, significant microstructural variations from multiphase crystalline states in cast rods to nanocomposite structures in ribbons were observed. The limited glass-forming ability (GFA) of the Ti75Zr10Si15 alloy results for melt-spun ribbons mainly in nanocomposite structures with \u00ce\u00b2-type nanocrystals being embedded in a glassy matrix. Addition of Nb increases the glass-forming ability. Raising the overheating temperature of the melt prior to melt-spinning from 1923\u00c2 K to 2053\u00c2 K yields for both alloys a higher amorphous phase fraction. The mechanical properties were investigated using compression tests (bulk samples) and the nano-indentation technique. A decrease of hardness (H), ultimate stress and reduced Young's modulus (E r) is observed for Ti60Zr10Nb15Si15 rods as compared to Ti75Zr10Si15 ones. This is attributed to an increase of the fraction of the \u00ce\u00b2-type phase.

For x > x c a transition to ferromagnetism is first observed followed at lower temperatures by an evolution to spin-glass behavior. Associated with this low temperature state are two distinct time scales corresponding to a resolution-limited elastic peak and to excitations. The temperature dependence of the elastic component is directly related to the spin-glass order parameter and indicates that there is a region of temperature where ferromagnetism and spin-glass order coexist.",

Firstly the same unidentified phase is formed in both these glasses and the KTP phase is formed only at higher temperatures. Transparent and opalescent KTP glasses exhibiting SHG activity may be produced by careful heat treatments at temperatures just above T g.

            "Statement of problem The effect of different surface treatment techniques on the bond strength of different types of ceramic-glass polymer computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD-CAM) materials and resin cements after aging is unknown. Purpose The purpose of this in\u00c2 vitro study was to evaluate the surface roughness of different ceramic-glass polymer CAD-CAM materials after 2 different surface treatments and the effect of material, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging on bond strength. Additionally, it was to determine any correlation between the surface roughness and bond strength. Material and methods CAD-CAM ceramic-glass polymer materials, a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (PICN) (VITA ENAMIC), a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate), and a nanoparticle-filled resin (Cerasmart) (1.5 mm in thickness; n=144) were divided into 2 subgroups in terms of surface treatments: airborne-particle abraded or silica-coated. The surface roughness values of specimens were measured. Composite resin cylinders were prepared and bonded to the restorative specimens using 2 different types of resin cements (dual-polymerizing [DP] and light-polymerizing [LP]). Half of the specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 hours, while the other half were submitted to 5000 thermocycles. The shear bond strength was measured, and the failure modes of the specimens were evaluated. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests (\u00ce\u00b1=.05). The correlation between roughness and bond strength values was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results Material (P=.012) and surface treatment type (P=.031) significantly affected the surface roughness. For bond strength, significant interactions were found among the material type, surface treatment, resin cement, and aging factors (P=.009). No significant correlation was found between roughness and bond strength (P=.943). Conclusions The surface treatment and resin cement type affected the bond strength and surface roughness of tested restorative materials. DP resin cement provided higher bond strength for airborne-particle abraded nanohybrid composite resin materials. LP resin cement achieved a higher bond strength when used with silica-coated, nanoparticle-filled resin and PICN materials.",

            "A series of Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped borosilicate glasses have been successfully prepared by melt-quenching method. As proved by transmission spectra, the copper ions are univalent in the investigated borosilicate glasses. Under ultraviolet (UV) excitation at 325\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm, the emission intensity of Eu3+ increased by nearly double due to a large overlapping between the Cu+ and Eu3+ emission peaks. The decreased excitation intensity in UV region and shortened emission lifetime of Cu+ in association with presence of Eu3+ ions consistently suggest an energy transfer process from Cu+ to Eu3+ ions. On the other hand, the partially allowed transition of Cu+ makes contribution to the red emission of Eu3+ at 611\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm in Cu+/Eu3+ co-doped samples, thus shortening the lifetime from the conventional millisecond (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc1.86\u00e2\u0080\u00afms) to the microsecond (up to around 37\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00ce\u00bcs) regime.

The results show that: (1) the plasticity of LSP treated specimens is still size-dependent, the smaller the specimen size is, the higher plasticity and compressive strength it has, which means the size effects of BMG can be preserved and inherited during LSP. (2) The same LSP treatment has different effects on different size specimens, the smaller the specimen size is, the greater effect it has, which indicates that LSP process causes much more obvious size-dependence in BMG. The mechanism for plasticity improvement can be attributed to the increase of free volume and the generation of deep compressive residual stress induced by LSP for each size specimen. Therefore, smaller specimen is corresponding with larger volume fraction of LSP affected zones and greater LSP effect.",

In addition, other effects such as crystalline electric field or disorder contribute to the rich phenomenology found in these compounds. The actual interest is focussed on the compounds where the magnetic order is suppressed at a given critical pressure P C or, in the case of induced chemical pressure, at a critical concentration x C. In this region, corresponding to a zero temperature phase transition, non-Fermi liquid behaviour on the specific heat, resistivity or susceptibility has been found. The first part of this article will be devoted to analyse the mentioned magnetic interactions and to describe the role of the different implied parameters (cell volume, number of electrons, etc). In the second part, we present the CeNi1\u00e2\u0088\u0092x Cu x system as an example of the interplay of the mentioned interactions leading to the disappearance of the long-range order.

In addition to a control OPC mix, an OPC/slag mix with 60% cement replacement by GGBS, and also AAS mixes were prepared with slag as the sole binder, activated with water glass at two dosages, 4% and 6% Na2O (by weight of slag). Two types of water glass were used, one in a solution form and the other in a solid granules form. The two forms of the activator used were also of different silicate modulus (M s); 1.65 for the solution form and 1.0 for the granule form. All the mixes had the same binder content and w/b=0.48.

The XRD pattern confirmed amorphous structural nature of synthesized tellurite glass, the DSC curve revealed good thermal stability with \u00ce\u0094 T >100\u00c2 \u00c2\u00b0C and the Raman spectrum displayed a stretching vibration band around 920\u00c2 cm\u00e2\u0088\u00921 for glass host with WO3.

The energy transfer mechanism between them was elucidated by analyzing fluorescence decay behavior of Tm3+ and quantitatively calculating energy transfer coefficient as well as phonon contribution ratio. Meanwhile, based on the absorption spectrum, some important spectroscopic parameters such as Judd-Ofelt parameter, spontaneous radiative transition probability, fluorescence branching ratio, absorption and emission cross-sections, and gain coefficient spectrum were calculated to reveal spectroscopic properties of doped Tm3+ ions.

Material and Methods Three conventional glass-ionomer cements (\u00ce\u00b1-Silver, \u00ce\u00b1-Fil, and Ketac-Molar) and 3 resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (Vitremer, Fuji II LC, and Photac-Fil Quick) were evaluated using measurements of compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and diametral tensile strength (DTS) at displacement rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm/min.

            "This experimental research aims to determine the influence of reinforcement hybridisation onto basic mechanical properties of misaligned short-fibre composites. For this purpose different short-fibre hybrid polypropylene composites with E-glass and cellulose reinforcements, which are characterised by different stress-strain characteristics were compounded and injection moulded. The volumetric fractions of reinforcement and compatibiliser contents were maintained at the proportional volumetric levels to enable correlation of filling ratios and reinforcement geometry with mechanical performance of the manufactured hybrids. This research helps to foresee mechanical performance of the newly developed hybrids and gives clues to effective hybridisation by showing the basic dependencies. It was found that especially flexural strength can be boosted by the addition of a second filler to short-fibres owing to its better response to compressive stresses during 3-point bending of the bar, as long as its Young's modulus is in the range or higher than that of fibres, has similar stress-strain characteristics and its good bonding with matrix is provided. The hybridisation of short-fibres with microfillers also reduces void content and fibre damage upon processing.",

The yield strength exceeding 2050MPa, Young's modulus of about 80GPa and the plastic strain of over 6.5% were obtained for 1% and 3% Nb-added alloys due to the suppression of the propagation of shear bands by nano-particles in situ formed in the glassy matrix.

            "Thirty years ago Fukuyama [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 45 (1978) 1474] predicted a transition from charge density wave (CDW) state to the charge density glass (CDG) at a finite temperature as the consequence of the competition between the uniform commensurability pinning and the random impurity pinning. We present strong evidence that the CDG phase indeed exists as a generic feature of density wave systems. However, it arises from the competition of the random impurity pinning and the electrostatic intra-CDW interaction which tends to establish a uniform phase at low temperature. The glass transition occurs at the temperature at which the free carriers cannot efficiently screen the phase distortions. The characteristic length scale of the disorder, i.e. the size of the phase coherent domains, governs the glass properties.",

The tensile strengths of the hybrid composites were predicted, from a theory formulated in this study, by using the strengths of the ABS/GB and ABS/GF composites alone. The addition of even a small quantity of glass fiber to ABS or ABS/GB composites changes the mode of deformation from one which shows vacuole growth and crazing to brittle failure. Thus, the elongation at break, the area under the stress/strain curve and the impact energy decrease sharply with the introduction of glass fiber to ABS or ABS/GB composites.",

The effects of up to 50% WGS on fresh, engineering and durability related properties have been established and its suitability for use in a range of normal-grade concrete production assessed. WGS characteristics results showed that the post-container glass waste can be crushed to provide WGS of physical properties that satisfy the current requirements set in appropriate standards for natural sand for concrete. The density and water absorption of WGS was found to be lower than natural sand. The results for fresh concrete showed a reduction in workability of concrete with increase WGS proportion beyond 20% in the mix, although slump measurements remained within the allowable margin of \u00c2\u00b125mm. The mixes with high proportions of WGS were found to be less cohesive.

The spectroscopic properties and mechanism of NIR broadband emission in these glasses were investigated in this work. Three excitation wavelengths of 500, 700 and 800nm were used to test emission spectra. The emission band under 500nm excitation can be regarded as combination of emission bands under 700 and 800nm excitation. 2.0mole% is found to be the optimal Bi2O3 doping level in this glass. Under 500nm excitation its emission peak, FWHM and lifetime of emission band are 1160nm, 300nm and 569\u00ce\u00bcs, respectively.

One major difficulty in the use of fiber reinforcement has been the addition of fibers during conventional processing methods. Purpose This study evaluated the effect of various lengths and concentrations of chopped E-glass fiber-reinforcement on the transverse strength, modulus of elasticity, and impact strength of injection and compression-molded polymethyl methacrylate based denture base polymer. Material and methods Test specimens (n=10) of 4-, 6-, and 8-mm fiber length and 1%, 3%, and 5% weight fiber concentrations were prepared with either an injection or a compression-molded processing method. Denture base polymer specimens without any fiber reinforcement were used as control for both processing methods. Transverse strength test specimens (65 \u00c3\u0097 10 \u00c3\u0097 2.5 mm) were stored in water bath at 37\u00c2\u00b0C for 2 weeks.

We have investigated metal\u00e2\u0080\u0093glass dynamics using inelastic X-ray scattering and ultrasonic techniques for several Pd-, Pt-, and Zr-based glasses with varying fragility. In some cases we have observed a faster phase velocity at short wavelengths than long wavelengths, or positive dispersion.

A strong 1.8\u00ce\u00bcm emission was observed in the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped bismuth germanate glass upon the excitation of a conventional 980nm laser diode. Using a spectral overlap model, the micro parameter for direct energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Tm3+ ions (C DA ) was found to be almost 30 times larger than the back energy transfer from Tm3+ ions to Yb3+ ions (C AD ). The linear dependence of energy transfer probability on the co-dopant concentration exhibits that the energy transfer is assisted by energy migration among donor ions. The large energy transfer efficiency (89%) indicates that the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped bismuth germanate glass is a good candidate for the 1.8\u00ce\u00bcm laser.",

Interestingly, single crystalline TiO2 nanorods (TiO2 NRs) offer more advantageous compared with TiO2 particles and polycrystalline. TiO2 NRs produce direct electrical pathways of photogenerated carriers as well as large surface areas between NRs. This work presents a synthesis of vertically-aligned and uniform TiO2 NRs that were hydrothermally grown on a transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The substrates were seeded with TiO2 compact layer (CL) using titanium (IV) butoxide as a precursor in HCl solution. Various techniques, including field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the morphology and crystalline structure of the prepared TiO2 NRs.

All the worthy characteristics which make Cu(TCNQ)2@Cu(Fe)OOH are endowed with an excellent OER catalytic performances with the required overpotential of 261\u00e2\u0080\u00afmV at 25\u00e2\u0080\u00afmA\u00e2\u0080\u00afcm\u00e2\u0088\u00922 only.

The branching ratios for the 1D2\u00e2\u0086\u00923F4 and 3P0\u00e2\u0086\u00923F2 emission transitions are above 40%. The fluorescence of Pr3+ in the visible bands was observed under 325nm pumping.

This study aimed to compare the fracture resistance and failure patterns of 90 mandibular molars restored using resin composites with or without fiber posts, with respect to the number of residual cavity walls. Five restoration types were performed corresponding to different wall defects (groups 1-5). Groups were divided in two subgroups corresponding to the use or absence of fiber posts. Teeth were loaded and resistance of specimens was measured as the axial compressive load to cause fracture and macroscopic fracture patterns were observed. One way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in fracture resistance (p < 0.001). Tukey post hoc test also revealed significant differences between groups as samples restored with fiber posts exhibited mostly restorable fractures. It was concluded that the resistance of endodontically treated mandibular molars restored with composite resins is mainly affected by the number of residual walls.

Furthermore, the mechanical test results showed that the composites of plain woven fabric had tensile strength of 434MPa and flexural strength of 407MPa.

The SEM analysis showed that many disorganized nano-fiber crystals appear in the tensile fracture surfaces, which improve the mechanical properties of the matrix resin.

            "A review of some long-standing problems, as well as some new theoretical results regarding non-Debye relaxation and the glass transition is given. The question of whether a phase transition below (or above) the glass transition temperature, T g, exists is considered. The result that the glass transition temperature and jumps in the dynamic heat capacity and volume expansion coefficient can be calculated if the relevant frequency-dependent linear response functions are known makes the question of the origin of non-Debye relaxation even more important. In effective medium theories, certainly valid at high temperatures, non-Debye relaxation is apparently due to dynamic effects of interactions. At lower temperatures, energy disorder is larger compared with kT, and percolation-based theories may be more appropriate. The question as to the actual magnitude of disorder in energies cannot be conclusively resolved at this time. Certainly, it has been shown that systems exist in which non-Debye relaxation is due exclusively to disorder but, in many systems, an important component of the energy disorder is a manifestation of the influence of topological disorder on interactions. Thus, in these systems, an increase in the magnitude of dynamic interactions relative to kT accompanies the increase in the disorder. The question as to whether universal properties imply universality in the mechanism of non-Debye relaxation is explored in some depth. The present article reaches the tentative conclusion that the relative importance of \u00e2\u0080\u0098disorder\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098interactions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 may be dependent on the type of glass considered, and possibly even on specific systems.

Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) was also used to improve the flexural and tensile strengths of shotcrete. In total, 76 different mix designs were prepared and tested to determine the setting time, flexural and tensile strength of shotcrete. The mixes were designed based on three influential parameters including GFRP, water/cement (w/c) ratio and the amount of DEA. According to the results, the flexural and tensile strengths of all specimens increased by adding 0.5% of the weight of GFRP. However, both tensile and flexural strengths showed an insignificant reduction by adding DEA to the mixes. The tensile and flexural strengths of specimens decreased slightly by adding DEA in the presence of GFRP. At a certain amount of DEA, the setting time increased twice with increasing the w/c ratio. The results showed a reduction in the shotcrete strength by using DEA. Thus, in the case where both the setting time and shotcrete strength are of great importance, the optimal DEA level is close to 0.3% of the dry weight of cement and 0.5% GFRP.",

The NIR upconversion phenomenon has been explained in terms of energy level schemes due to excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) processes.",

            "A charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state that exists in Nb3Te4 below 115 K is not observed in the isostructural and isoelectronic Nb3Se4 and Nb3S4. Intercalating indium into Nb3Se4 induces a Peierls transition to a CDW ground state near 35 K judging by a peak in the resistivity. The onset temperature of this resistance peak is influenced by the mole fraction intercalated. Electron diffraction (ED) evidence supports these findings. In contrast, intercalating Nb3S4 with indium does not produce a resistivity peak above \u00e2\u0088\u00bc12 K to suggest the presence of a CDW ground state. An electron diffraction study has linked complex superlattice satellites (SLS) near 90 K in both chalcogenides to a CDW transition but the present resistivity results suggest that this is not the case. A number of other guests intercalated into either chalcogenide do not produce any resistivity features to suggest a Peierls transition. A CDW does, however, appear to exist in Ga1.0Nb3Te4 and provides support for an apparent synergism between group III metals intercalated into Nb3Te4 and Nb3Se4 and the existence of a CDW ground state. Pulsed resistivity measurements of In1.0Nb3Se4 at 12 K with fields to \u00e2\u0088\u00bc20 V/cm indicate that the electrical transport remains ohmic.",

Second, the temperature T oz at which the fluctuations in the gap parameter equal the average gap parameter is calculated as a function of the coupling, and is found to behave in a similar way to T BE . Both these temperatures go continuously to zero as the system becomes one-dimensional while T c calculated in mean-field theory does not vanish in this limit.

So, it is possible to produce BMGs that are several centimeters thick. BMGs exhibit useful engineering properties of high mechanical strength and high corrosion resistance. In order to extend the engineering application of BMGs, it is necessary to establish appropriate joint process of BMG / BMG and BMG / crystalline metal.

            "Hot-pressing deformation treatment was carried out at different strain rates and temperatures to improve the microstructure homogeneity of the TiZr-based bulk metallic glass matrix composites (BMGMCs) after enlargement. At a compression strain rate of 0.001/s and temperature of 653\u00e2\u0080\u00afK, the TiZr-based BMGMCs exhibited good plastic rheological properties in supercooled liquid region. After work hardening to the peak stress, steady-state flow stress was rapidly obtained, resulting in a stress drop of 223\u00e2\u0080\u00afMPa. Moreover, during this period, no rapid stress drop and fracture phenomena were observed. Compared with those of the as-cast morphology, the distribution of dendrite and glass matrix was more homogeneous after 31% thickness reduction in hot-pressing deformation. Accompanied with viscous flow of the glass matrix, the dendrites markedly aggregated together after a thickness reduction ratio of 58%. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that a large amount of dislocations formed in the dendrite, and a large amount of nanocrystals precipitated from the glass matrix after hot-pressing treatment. The amount of the nanoparticles continued to increase as the amount of deformation increased. TiZr-based BMGMCs with 31% compression deformation possessed both the distinguished plastic strain (\u00ce\u00b5 p) of 3.95% and ultimate strength (\u00cf\u0083 max) of 1595\u00e2\u0080\u00afMPa. The stress\u00e2\u0080\u0093strain curve demonstrated that the rate of stress drop considerably slowed down after tensile strength reached a maximum due to hot-pressing deformation. The rapid expansion of the shear band was efficiently hindered through the combined effect of partial nanocrystallization of the glass matrix and deformation hardening of the dendrite. This condition further improves the total coordinated deformation capacity of TiZr-based BMGMCs.",

Herein, we report a facile synthesis method of highly porous three-dimensional (3D) CoO/RGO nanocomposite via ozone treatment, ice templating, and thermal annealing. The ozonized RGO surface provides a favorable interaction with cobalt precursor for a stable and uniform deposition of well-defined CoO nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, and chemistry of the resulting CoO/RGO nanocomposites are comprehensively characterized by spectroscopic methods. The CoO/RGO nanocomposites show fast and reversible pseudocapacitance due to a large accessible area, rapid ion transport, and low charge transfer resistance arising from 3D internetworked macroporosity. Thus, the nanocomposites achieve high specific capacitance up to 239.4Fg-1 (volumetric capacitance = 12.04Fcm-3), excellent rate capability of 79.1%, and ultralong cyclic stabilities (of 93.2% at 10Ag-1 even up to 10,000 cycles) in 6M KOH electrolyte.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the application of dentin primer and/or dentin bonding agent on the adhesion of a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement to dentin. Methods. Bovine dentin was pretreated with Dentin Conditioner or EDTA 3-2 solution, primed by an experimental dentin primer, and applied with a dentin bonding agent. A resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, Fuji II LC, was then adhered to the dentin. The tensile bond strength between the light-cured glass-ionomer cement and the pretreated dentin was measured. The components of the experimental dentin primers were 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glyceryl methacrylate (GM) and a water-soluble photo-polymerization initiator, 2-hydroxy-3-(3,4-dimethyl-9-oxo-9H-thioxanthen-2-yloxy)-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium chloride (OTX). Significant differences in the data were examined by an analysis of variance and Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons between the means at p=0.05. Results. A significantly higher mean bond strength between the Fuji II LC and dentin was obtained by EDTA 3-2 pretreatment, QTX/GM priming, and LB Bond application. This value was comparable with that obtained with the resin composite system. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed the formation of a hybrid layer with a thickness of 1\u00e2\u0080\u00931.5\u00ce\u00bcm. Significance.

Their morphology, chemical and electrochemical characterization are investigated. The morphology and porosity measurements of the membranes show that the PDA coating does not harm to the structure of the electrospun PVDF nanofibrous membranes. Due to the PDA coating, it makes the PVDF surface hydrophilic and thus increases the electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity, resulting in the enhanced performance of batteries. The battery using the PDA coated PVDF nanofibrous separator exhibits better cycling performance and higher power capability than that the battery using the bare PVDF nanofibrous separator. This study underlines that the PDA-coating treatment provides a promising process for the fabrication of advanced electrospun nanofibers separator in the lithium-ion battery applications.",

            "Summary Objectives. To evaluate the effects of water storage, thermocycling, and the incorporation of glass-fibers, on the flexural strength of veneering composites. Methods. Veneering composites with different fillers, matrices and polymerization methods (Belleglass Kerr Inc., Orange, CA, USA; Sculpture, Pentron Inc. Wallingford CT, USA; Sinfony, 3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany; SR Adoro LC and HP, Targis, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), a glass-fiber framework material (Vectris Pontic VP, Ivoclar Vivadent) and a direct restorative composite control (Tetric Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent) were selected. For the first part of the study, 30 bar specimens (25\u00c3\u00972\u00c3\u00972mm3) per material were fabricated. Ten were stored for 24h and 10 for 14 days in water at 37\u00c2\u00b0C. Ten were thermocycled (3000\u00c3\u0097; 5\u00e2\u0080\u009350\u00e2\u0080\u00935\u00c2\u00b0C). Three-point bending tests (crosshead speed: 0.5mm/min) were performed. For the second part of the study, all veneering materials were combined with a glass-fiber framework (VP). Sixty specimens were produced for each material (25\u00c3\u00974\u00c3\u00972mm3) and treated as in the first part. Three-point bend tests were performed with the reinforcing glass-fiber framework either on the tension or the compression side. Data was evaluated by ANOVA and Weibull analysis. Results. A decrease in flexural strength was observed after water storage or thermocycling for all veneering materials tested. None of the tested materials exhibited significant advantages compared to the control. The flexural strength of glass-fiber reinforced frameworks was ten times higher and not influenced by water storage or thermocycling. A significant reinforcing effect from glass fibers was observed when they were placed on the tension but not when placed on the compression side. Significance. A glass-fiber framework on the tension side significantly improved the flexural strength of veneering composites. There was less deterioration due to water storage and thermocycling with the glass-fiber reinforced veneering composite compared to the non-reinforced materials.",

This is attributed to the limited strain-rate-dependence of mechanical behavior of the B2-CuZr phase, which is induced by the martensitic transformation effect of the phase during deformation. It is obvious that the SRS ceiling of the CuZr-based BMGCs is controlled by the B2-CuZr phase.",

Fukunaga, K. Itoh, T. Otomo, K. Mori, M. Sugiyama, H. Kato, M. Hasegawa, A. Hirata, Y. Hirotsu, Intermetallics 14 (2006) 893]. The electronic structure of the former is similar to that of the relevant Zr2Ni compound, while that of the latter is completely different from that of the relevant Zr2Cu compound. We have also calculated the band energy of the characteristic clusters in these metallic glasses. The smaller and Zr-richer these clusters are, the lower the band energy at the center of the cluster tends to be. The stability of these characteristic clusters of both metallic glasses can be explained by the total band energy based on the calculated local density of states and is consistent with the reported experimental Volonoi analysis.",

The extent of phase segregation, as judged from the mean droplet diameter and the packing density of droplets, decreased with increasing CaF2 content in the glasses. A slight depolymerisation of the glass network was observed according to magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies, suggesting a network modifier role for CaF2.

The laminates were designed by choosing an appropriate ratio of the carbon thickness to the laminate thickness using a robust analytical damage mode map. The experimental results verified the analytical predictions and showed a desirable pseudo-ductile failure in all the fibre orientations. Microscope images taken through the laminates thickness showed fragmentations (fibre fractures in the carbon layer) appearing only in the 0\u00c2\u00b0 carbon plies. A hybrid effect was observed, with an increase in strain and stress to failure of the carbon fibres, which was found to be dependent on the stiffness of the plies separating the 0\u00c2\u00b0 carbon plies and the plies adjacent to the 0\u00c2\u00b0 carbon plies.

Post-impact flexural tests have been also monitored using acoustic emission in order to get further information on failure mechanisms. Results showed that basalt and hybrid laminates with an intercalated configuration exhibited higher impact energy absorption capacity than glass laminates, and enhanced damage tolerance capability. Conversely, the most favorable flexural behavior was shown by laminates with symmetrical sandwich-like configuration (E-glass fiber fabrics as core and basalt fiber fabrics as skins).",

The Judd\u00e2\u0080\u0093Ofelt theory has been used to predict the transition probabilities, branching ratios and lifetimes for the various excited states of Er3+ ions in 0.5mol% of Er2O3-doped glass.

The fluorescence intensity ratio of the green emissions associated to the two transitions from the thermally coupled 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level of Er3+ ion has been studied as a function of temperature, and in turn used to determine the thermal sensitivity and relative thermal sensitivity of the glasses.

The densification, microstructural evolution, phase transformation and mechanical properties of the scan tracks were systematically investigated. It was found that the morphology of the scan track was influenced by the energy distribution of the laser beam and the heat transfer competition between convection and conduction in the melt pool. Due to the Gaussian distribution of laser energy and heat transfer process, different regions of the scan track experienced different thermal histories, resulting in a gradient microstructure and mechanical properties. Higher laser powers caused higher thermal stresses, which led to the formation of cracks; while low power reduced the strength of the laser track, also inducing cracking.

The rate of flow increased about six times compared with that obtained without a tube. A pressure gradient was produced in the tube by the flow of the solids and the suction effects of this pressure gradient increased the rate of flow of solids. The relation between the negative pressure below the orifice and the rate of flow has been explained satisfactorily by the equation given by Bulsara et al. The introduction of air into the efflux tube below the orifice reduced the effect of the tube, and control of the rate of air introduction gave an easy method for the smooth control of the rate of solids flow.",

The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the flexural properties (strength and modulus), failure mode, superficial morphology, and roughness of two CAD-CAM glass fiber posts (milled at different angulations) compared with a commercially available prefabricated glass fiber post. Three groups were tested (n\u00e2\u0080\u00af=\u00e2\u0080\u00af10): PF (control group)\u00e2\u0080\u0093 prefabricated glass fiber post; C-Cd\u00e2\u0080\u0093diagonally milled post; and C-Cv\u00e2\u0080\u0093vertically milled post. A 3-dimensional virtual image was obtained from a prefabricated post, which guided the posterior milling of posts from a glass fiber disk (Trilor Blanks; Bioloren).

The effects of B content, Ti content, and the brazing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the brazed joints were investigated. The typical interfacial microstructure of the brazed joint was: Al2O3/Ti3(Cu, Al)3O/Ag(s.s)+TiB+Ti(Cu, Al)+fine AlCu2Ti/blocky AlCu2Ti+AlCuTi/TiAl. TiB whiskers synthesized in situ by the reaction of the B additive with Ti, served as nucleation sites for the formation of fine Ti(Cu, Al) and AlCu2Ti grains and improved the bonding properties. With increasing B content, more fine-grains were formed in the brazing seam and the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O reaction layer adjacent to the Al2O3 ceramic decreased. Brazing parameters also influenced the joint microstructure. Growth of Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer and AlCu2Ti formed with increase in brazing temperature. Moreover, the formation of dispersed fine-grains in the brazing seam depended largely on the initial Ti content in the composite filler. With increase in initial Ti content, the TiB-reinforced area was broadened while the blocky AlCu2Ti content decreased gradually. The maximum shear strength of Al2O3/TiAl joint brazed with B-reinforced composite filler was 148MPa, which was 246% higher than that brazed without B addition. The joint shear strength was determined by the combined influences of the thermal expansion mismatch between the joined materials, the thickness of the Ti3(Cu, Al)3O layer, and the presence of defects in the joints.",

            "Coatings made from neat vinyl ester and nanoclay reinforced vinyl ester composites are applied onto individual glass fibers as well as rovings to evaluate their barrier resistance against alkali and moisture attack. The fibers coated with clay nanocomposites present a significantly less damage caused by the diffusing alkali ions, giving rise to a much higher residual tensile strength after aging than the fibers without coating or those with a neat polymer coating. The static fatigue test performed on individual fibers verifies the advantage of using nanoclay composite to retard the corrosion process under the combined stress and alkaline environment. Similar beneficial effects of incorporating nanoclay on residual strength are identified for impregnated fiber bundles. The above observations confirm the excellent barrier characteristics of intercalated/exfoliated nanoclay in polymer that are applied in composite structures on both the microscopic and macroscopic scales.",

However, the filled resin absorbs significantly more water than unfilled polyester. Tensile load was found to have no effect on the water uptake in plain polyester. However, moisture absorption was affected by tensile load in 20% (by volume) bead-filled polyester and in SMC-R65. Increasing load increased the diffusion coefficient in SMC-R65. Combining rules predicted the diffusion coefficient in unloaded SMC-R65, but could not account for changes in diffusivity caused by tensile loading.

The residual strength coefficient of the mortars after high temperature exposure increased with the increase of CAC content and could be higher than 100%.

            "The compressive and tensile deformation, as well as the fracture behavior of a Zr59Cu20Al10Ni8Ti3 bulk metallic glass were investigated. It was found that under compressive loading, the metallic glass displays some plasticity before fracture. The fracture is mainly localized on one major shear band and the compressive fracture angle, \u00ce\u00b8 C, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is 43\u00c2\u00b0. Under tensile loading, the material always displays brittle fracture without yielding. The tensile fracture stress, \u00cf\u0083 F T, is about 1.58 GPa, which is lower than the compressive fracture stress, \u00cf\u0083 F C(=1.69 GPa). The tensile fracture angle, \u00ce\u00b8 T, between the stress axis and the fracture plane is equal to 54\u00c2\u00b0. Therefore, both \u00ce\u00b8 C and \u00ce\u00b8 T deviate from the maximum shear stress plane (45\u00c2\u00b0), indicating that the fracture behavior of the metallic glass under compressive and tensile load does not follow the von Mises criterion. Scanning electron microscope observations reveal that the compressive fracture surfaces of the metallic glass mainly consist of a vein-like structure. A combined feature of veins and some radiate cores was observed on the tensile fracture surfaces. Based on these results, the fracture mechanisms of metallic glass are discussed by taking the effect of normal stress on the fracture process into account. It is proposed that tensile fracture first originates from the radiate cores induced by the normal stress, then propagates mainly driven by shear stress, leading to the formation of the combined fracture feature. In contrast, the compressive fracture of metallic glass is mainly controlled by the shear stress. It is suggested that the deviation of \u00ce\u00b8 C and \u00ce\u00b8 T from 45\u00c2\u00b0 can be attributed to a combined effect of the normal and shear stresses on the fracture plane.",

The equilibrium phase boundary line between the normal and superconducting phases in the H-T plane obtained by fitting the resistive transition is consistent with that obtained by the I-V curve measurements.

The first panel was made of epoxy resin, second one is of hybrid resin (a blend of 60% epoxy and 40% polyester) and the remaining three panels were made of hybrid resin with MWCNT in three different proportions by weight (0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0%). The composite and nano-composite panels were characterized experimentally for the important issues in the field of aerospace engineering, like medium velocity bullet impact response and vibration damping characteristics. The MWCNTs were responsible for greater characteristics improvement in the hybrid resin due to their high tendency to absorb the impact shock. The panels without MWCNT turn out to be lesser shock absorption capability. Additionally, 0.1% MWCNT hybrid panel shows exceptional damping response by damping the impacted vibration within 9.5 ms. There is also a 175.51% increase in the damping ratio of the panel. The higher percentage MWCNTs show lesser response towards damping of vibration. This may be due to the lengthy entangled structure of MWCNTs in the resin. It is also observed that the impacted damage is higher in the epoxy system panel than the nano-composite panel.",

This study investigated the effect of MgO nanoparticles on the setting time, compressive and diametral tensile strength, and adhesive properties of glass-ionomer cement. A conventional GIC was modified by the incorporation of MgO nanoparticles at 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (w/w) ratios with an unmodified GIC used as the control group. The data were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD test (p\u00e2\u0080\u00af<\u00e2\u0080\u00af0.05). Although the GICs with 1% and 2.5% MgO nanoparticles were still within the ISO standard range specified for the GIC setting time, increasing the MgO nanoparticle concentration significantly increased the setting time of the tested cement (p\u00e2\u0080\u00af<\u00e2\u0080\u00af0.05). GICs with 1% MgO nanoparticles had the highest compressive and diametral tensile strength values. Increasing the nanoparticle content from 5% and more significantly decreased the cement strength (p\u00e2\u0080\u00af<\u00e2\u0080\u00af0.05). The shear bond strength (SBS) of enamel and dentine showed statistically significant differences among the tested groups (p\u00e2\u0080\u00af<\u00e2\u0080\u00af0.05). However, the addition of MgO nanoparticles up to 5% (w/w) did not have an unfavourable effect on the cement adhesiveness.

The amount and size of B2-CuZr nanocrystallites precipitated from the glass matrix increase with enhancing the pre-compression stress, which suggests that the appropriate pre-compression treatment promotes the formation of metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs). The 850MPa pre-compressed MGMC possesses the highest compressive fracture strength (1814MPa) and a certain degree of plasticity, as well as the larger hardness of 700HV. The 1415MPa pre-compressed MGMC with more B2-CuZr nanocrystallites demonstrates advantages in thermal stability and corrosion resistance in the seawater solution.

A series of uniaxial, deformation-controlled tension tests was performed to study the strength, deformation, and fracture behaviour of thin, narrow plates made of TRC with and without the addition of short fibres. Furthermore, multifilament-yarn pullout and single-fibre pullout tests were carried out to gain a better understanding of the crack-bridging behaviour which suppresses growth and widening of cracks. Pronounced enhancement of first-crack stress was achieved, the value increased by factors of 1.5 and 2 due to the addition of glass and carbon fibres, respectively. While more and finer cracks were observed on the specimens with short fibres added, a moderate improvement in tensile strength was recorded. Water-to-binder ratio influences the matrix\u00e2\u0080\u0093fibre bond quality and thus fibre failure mode. While fibre fracture dominated behaviour when matrix M030 (low water-to-binder ratio of 0.30) was used, pronounced pullout behaviour was observed for fibres embedded in the matrix with a higher w/b ratio (M045). Furthermore, it was found that short fibres can also improve the bond between multifilament-yarns and the surrounding matrix by means of new cross-links.",

At low calcium oxide content the structure of calcium borate glass consists mainly of boroxol groups and a smaller number of pentaborate groups. In the vitreous network there are few diborate groups, chain type metaborate groups and pyroborate groups. At high calcium oxide content, pentaborate, orthoborate and metaborate groups appear. The increase of calcium oxide content yields an increase in number of non-bridging oxygen ions. Therefore, we conclude that calcium ions act as network modifiers in borate glasses.",

Previously, it was reported that proteins were immobilized onto PPHMDSO thin film [H. Miyachi, A. Hiratsuka, K. Ikebukuro, K. Yano, H. Muguruma, I. Karube, Biotechnol.

Hydrophilic surfaces were detected by measuring the contact angle of water. Of great interest, proteins were strictly immobilized on the patterned O2 plasma treated areas, providing more efficient ways for fabricating the protein chips.",

Composites with such flaws, when subjected to adverse environmental conditions in the presence of a sustained load, may have reduced mechanical properties and changes in their microstructural properties up to failure. E-glass/vinyl ester composite coupons with a single edge flaw have been conditioned for periods up to 7900 h at room temperature and at an elevated temperature, with and without a sustained load, to determine the changes in the tensile properties and damage mechanisms which occur with the introduction of the flaw. The early damage mechanisms have been found to change from transverse matrix cracking, fiber cracking, and occasional edge delaminations for unnotched specimens to the growth of a significant matrix crack from the notch tip and well-defined longitudinal tow debonding for notched specimens.",

            "Introduction of underlayer is one of the mitigation methods commonly used for the suppression of the Sn whiskering phenomenon in electronic packaging. The presence of a proper underlayer prevents the intermetallic compound formation resulting from a Cu/Sn interaction believed to be the major driving force of Sn whisker growth. Ni as an underlayer has been widely studied and industrially accepted. However, Ni underlayer suffers from its polycrystalline grain structure where grain boundaries can potentially act as a diffusion path for the Cu/Sn interaction to take place. In this study, a 100-nm-thick Zr46Ti26Ni28 thin film metallic glass (TFMG) is introduced to block the Cu/Sn interaction. Samples with and without TFMG underlayer were aged at room temperature for up to 33days in ambient atmosphere. No Sn whisker is observed in the sample with TFMG underlayer after aging. In contrast, Sn whiskers are found in the absence of the underlayer and the whisker density increases with increasing aging time. It is found that TFMG underlayer plays an important role in effectively suppressing Sn whisker growth.",

The microstructure, tensile and compressive deformation behaviors and fracture morphology of laser solid formed Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 BMGs were investigated. It is found that the crystallization mainly occurs in the heat-affected zones of deposition layers, which consist of Al5Ni3Zr2, NiZr2, ZrCu, CuZr2 phases. The content of amorphous phase in the deposit is about 63%. Under the compressive loading, the deposit presents no plasticity before fracture occurs. The fracture process is mainly controlled by the shear stress and the compressive shear fracture angles of about 39\u00c2\u00b0. The compressive strength reaches 1452\u00e2\u0080\u0089MPa, which is equivalent to that of as-Cast Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 BMGs, and there exist vein-like patterns, river-like patterns and smooth regions at the compressive fractography. Under the tensile loading, the deposit presents the brittle fracture pattern without plastic deformation.

The plasticity of about 8% was obtained from the as-cast 2-mm-diameter rod with an aspect ratio of 2, concomitant obvious work hardening effect. The present BMG possessing exceptional GFA and remarkable compressive plasticity simultaneously may have a scientific importance on developing BMGs for structural applications.",

IGZO thin films were subsequently prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method under different pressures at room temperature. The structural and physical properties of the as-grown films were diagnosed by various tools. It was confirmed that all the films exhibited amorphous structure. With the increase of oxygen pressure from 1.0Pa to 15.0Pa, surface roughness of IGZO films increased from 0.60nm to 1.82nm.

Heat treatment at 500\u00c2\u00b0C with LiNO3 molten salt caused a lithium metasilicate, Li2SiO3, crystal phase to appear after 5\u00e2\u0080\u009396 h. By contrast, glass powder heat-treated in air at 500\u00c2\u00b0C remained amorphous after 5 h and turned into lithium disilicate, Li2Si2O5, crystal after 40 h. Qualitatively similar results were obtained at 400\u00c2\u00b0C. Glass powder heat-treated at 575\u00c2\u00b0C in both molten salt and in air turned into lithium disilicate crystal. Metasilicate crystallization occurs with LiNO3 molten salt at 500 and 400\u00c2\u00b0C due to the incorporation of lithium into the sample glass powder from the melt during crystallization. An increase in lithium content in the sample after molten salt heat treatment was confirmed by chemical analysis using dc plasma emission spectroscopy.",

            "A preliminary study has shown that bulk metallic glasses of the CuZrAl type of large dimension may be manufactured from amorphous powders densified by a process of sintering such as spark plasma sintering (SPS). However, to remedy the lack of plasticity of these materials, the addition of ductile crystalline particles was carried out in the present study. The zirconium was chosen because its properties are close to those of the amorphous matrix. The same sintering parameters as those optimized for the metallic glass are also applicable for the production of the composite for the different zirconium volume fractions retained, respectively 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. The materials obtained are dense. X-ray diffraction clearly indicates that only the amorphous matrix CuZrAl and the crystalline zirconium are present. Young's modulus as well as the elastic limit decrease only very slightly with the addition of crystalline particles. Decrease in hardness is more pronounced. On the other hand, the plastic deformation increases with the addition of zirconium, reaching about 4.9% for the alloy containing 50% zirconium. The analysis of the fracture surfaces clearly shows the role of the ductile crystalline particles, namely the deceleration of the shear bands. The influence of volume fraction and size of the crystalline particles and of matrix toughness is discussed from a mechanical point of view. Therefore, SPS is a solution to solve both the problem of size and low ductility of amorphous metal, since it is possible to control microstructure and so to control mechanical properties.",

The critical cooling rate required to form an amorphous state in this system is generally low, and comparable to that of some of the best metallic glass formers, such as Pd\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Cu\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Si. Amorphous ribbons up to 0.25 mm thick can easily be produced by the single-roller melt-spinning technique. Tensile strengths as high as 1280 MPa and Young's modulus of 75 GPa have been obtained. Bulk amorphous alloys with good mechanical properties are optimized in Al85Ni6Fe3Gd6. DSC and DTA studies reveal that the glass formability is unique for Al-based alloys because the reduced glass temperature T rg for Al\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Ni\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Fe\u00ee\u0097\u00b8Gd can be as low as 0.44.

The concentration dependences of T g and heat capacity jump at T g also showed anomalies around x =0.25.

The effects of quasicrystals on the deformation behavior of the materials were studied by nanoindentation and compression test. It revealed that the alloys with homogeneous amorphous structure exhibit pronounced flow serrations during the nanoindentation loading, while no obvious flow serration is observed for the sample with quasicrystals more than 10vol.%. However, further compression tests confirm that the no-serrated flows are formed due to different reasons. For annealed samples containing quasicrystals less than 35vol.%, continuous plastic deformation occurs due to propagation of multiple shear bands. While the disappearance of serrated flow cannot be explained by the generation of multiple shear bands for samples containing quasicrystals more than 35vol.%, which will fracture with a totally different fracture mode, namely, dimple fracture mode under loading instead of shear fracture mode.",

            "The sloshing impact load of liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers is an important issue that can cause failure of the insulation system of LNG cargo containment systems, leading to cryogenic leakage from the hull of the ship and generation of boil-off gas. Thus, insulation systems should be designed by considering the repeated impact loading based on the design life as well as the cryogenic temperature. Polyurethane foam (PUF), epoxy resin, and plywood are acceptable materials that can be used to fabricate a typical insulation system to protect the load from the environment. In this study, we investigated the effect of adding hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) to the epoxy resin on the reinforcement of the insulation material. Specimens were fabricated using PUF, plywood, and an HGM/epoxy composite matrix with varying weight fractions of embedded HGM (0, 10, and 20\u00c2 wt.%). The sloshing impact loads were estimated by the statistical method of the Weibull model, and the top 2% level of the Weibull distribution was selected.

After welding, the microstructure evolution, glass forming ability (GFA) and mechanical properties of the welded samples were determined by a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the Vickers microhardness test. Test results showed that the parent material (PM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld fusion zone (WFZ) in the welds all consist of an amorphous matrix with two kinds of Ta particles: micro-sized and nano-sized. In the WFZ, during the rapid melting, the partial dissolution of micro-sized Ta particles resulted in the reduction of their volume fraction. After subsequent rapid cooling, partial micro-sized Ta particles were transformed to nano-sized particles or nano-sized particle accumulations. This transformation resulted in a slightly higher magnitude of hardness in the WFZ. Furthermore, it was found that the surrounding area of micro-sized Ta in the WFZ has better resistance to the etchant solution. In the HAZ, small amounts of Zr2Cu and nano-sized Ta tended to precipitate on the micro-sized Ta surface, and may act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. However, the small amount of precipitation in the HAZ and the micro-sized Ta transformation in the WFZ did not significantly affect the magnitude of the GFA indices, \u00ce\u0094T x, \u00ce\u00b3 and \u00ce\u00b3 m, when compared to that of un-welded BMG-C.",

Results indicated that only a small part of the periphery of the WC in the WC-added coatings was melted, and the un-melted WC particles in the coatings acted as a hard reinforcement. Besides, the microhardness in the cladding layer increased with the increment of the mass fraction of WC particles, and presented a gradient distribution along in-depth direction of the coatings.

In comparison to the as-cast Zr-based alloy without distinct plasticity, the LSM treated one exhibited compressive plastic strain of 5.3% prior to fracture. The improvement in mechanical behavior of the LSM treated metallic glass may be resulted from complex residual stress distributions and increase in free volume in the surface layer induced by LSM treatment.",

            "In this work, alumina nanoparticles at various concentrations were used to modify the epoxy system to develop the composites along with unidirectional (UD) glass-fibers. In order to understand the influence of alumina nanoparticles over the directional compressive properties, tests were performed along longitudinal and transverse directions of the laminate using a universal testing machine. To generate the base line data the laminates with the unmodified matrix are also tested. The maximum enhancement of compressive properties were seen in the composite having 1.0wt% of alumina nanoparticles. The compressive modulus and compressive strength was found to be 17.76% and 19.43% in the transverse direction where as it found to be 2.89% and 3.44% in the longitudinal direction respectively. Results of the present study showed that glass-fiber reinforced nano-modified polymers (GFRP) exhibit significantly improved compressive properties such as compressive strength and compressive modulus along the transverse direction while the properties along the longitudinal direction were not affected much by the nano-fillers, due to the dominating effect of the fiber-reinforcement.

The composites were fabricated by the technique of vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The interlaminar shear strength, flexural properties, impact absorption energy, and tensile properties of the composites were evaluated, and the results were compared to those acquired from GFs/epoxy composite as well as GFs/epoxy composites containing chopped glass microfibers (GMFs); additionally, the reinforcement and/or toughening mechanisms were investigated.

Several physical and chemical methods for preparing graphene and RGO films have been reported, but a facile and efficient method is still lacking. Here, we report a facile and effective electrochemical method to prepare RGO films from a GO aqueous solution. By applying a low direct current voltage (several volts) to an electrolytic cell made with two indium tin oxide (ITO) glass plates for a short time (in seconds), GO nanosheets close to the cathodal ITO glass surface are reduced and directly deposited on the surface to form RGO films, which show metallic luster and semi-transparency. The thickness and transmittance of the RGO films can be adjusted by changing reduction time and applied voltage. Moreover, patterned RGO films could be obtained by using patterned ITO glass plates. Very impressively, large-sized RGO films can be prepared on a large-sized ITO glass plate, and they can be peeled off by using an adhesive tape. The facile preparation of RGO films with controllable thickness, transmittance, pattern and size would facilitate their practical applications.",

Unfortunately, however, determining the chemical composition of residual glass is far from trivial and there are very few publications on this matter. In this paper, we used electrical conductivity measurements by impedance spectroscopy to infer the composition of the residual glass in partially crystallized Li2SiO3-CaSiO3 glasses. The glass-ceramics were obtained by heat-treatment at 560\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b0C for distinct periods, in conditions where only lithium-metasilicate (Li2SiO3) crystallized. Consequently, residual glasses of the resulting glass-ceramics became depleted in lithium, and their ionic conductivity and the respective activation energies changed accordingly. Therefore, we obtained the compositions of residual glasses by comparing the glass-ceramics ionic conductivities and activation energies with those of reference glasses having known chemical composition. We validated these two methods by comparing the obtained residual glass compositions with those obtained using a technique that relates the glass transition temperatures of reference glasses with those of glass-ceramics. These novel methods employing ionic conductivity and activation energy yield similar results to those obtained using the glass transition temperature method. However, the electrical property techniques are non-destructive and can be used to follow the crystallization process in situ.",

Two different methods were used to induce transformation to the amorphous form of the alloy: laser melting and HVOF spraying. Both methods produced largely amorphous material, however the high brittleness of the alloy makes it susceptible to cracking during laser treatment, hence this technique is not suitable for large-scale application. Potentiodynamic scanning showed that in 0.5M H2SO4 and 3.5% NaCl electrolytes both amorphous forms of the alloy had better corrosion resistance (lower current densities for \u00e2\u0088\u0092200 to +1000mV SCE) compared to the crystalline material.

TMA studies also showed better thermal stability and lower thermal expansion in the CNF-loaded GRPC. CNF-loaded GRPC showed higher ILSS due to better interfacial bonding between the fiber and matrix due to the presence of CNFs.

The experimental program consisted of testing 54 concrete cube specimens prepared according to CSA S802-02 standard. Two main parameters were considered in the experimental investigation: the compressive strength of concrete (from 25.6MPa to 92.4MPa) and the type of rebar (steel, sand-coated GFRP, and helically wrapped GFRP). The test results showed that the interfacial bond strength of the GFRP bars increased as the compressive strength of concrete increased. However, the increasing rate of the bond strength of the GFRP bars with respect to the concrete strength was much smaller than that of the steel bars. The concrete specimens were sawn in half after the test for a closer investigation of the actual mode of bond failure. Visual examination of the specimens showed that bond failure of the steel bar was caused by concrete crushing against the face of the ribs, while bond failure of the GFRP bars occurred not only in the concrete but also in the bars by delamination of the resin-rich outer layer from the fiber core. The average area of the delaminated resin-rich layer of the GFRP bar increased with increasing compressive strength of concrete.",

These glasses have shown strong absorption bands in the near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) region. For Pr3+ doped glass, emission bands centered at 608nm (3P0 \u00e2\u0086\u0092 3H6 + 1D2 \u00e2\u0088\u0092 3H4), 640nm (3P0 \u00e2\u0086\u0092 3F2), 686nm (3P0\u00e2\u0080\u00933F3) and 723nm (3P0 \u00e2\u0086\u0092 3F4) have been observed with 480nm (3H4 \u00e2\u0086\u0092 3P0) excitation wavelength.

Transverse and longitudinal polished sections were examined by scanning electron microscopy and evaluated by computer-assisted image analysis. Physical parameters, including volume % of fibers, their dispersion index and coordination number, were calculated and correlated with mechanical properties. The weaker posts showed more fiber dispersion, higher resin contents, larger numbers of visible defects and reduced fatigue resistance. The flexural strength was inversely correlated with fiber diameter and the flexural modulus was weakly related to coordination number, volume % of fibers and dispersion index.

Carbon layers were replaced partially by basalt and/or glass fibres to explore the effects of hybrid ratio and stacking sequence on the flexural behavior and material usage. Hybrid laminates were manufactured by vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. Three-point bending tests were carried out to characterize the flexural properties and failure mechanisms of the hybrid composite laminates. The fracture surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that flexural strength and modulus of the hybrid laminates decreased with the increase in the hybrid ratio of basalt fibres ranging from 0 to 50%; however negligible effects on flexural properties were observed when hybrid ratio increased further up to 75%. For the hybrid samples, a higher flexural modulus can be obtained by placing carbon layers on the both tensile and compressive sides symmetrically; and a higher flexural strength can be achieved by placing basalt or glass fibre through a sandwich-like stacking sequence with a hybrid ratio of 50%.

As indicated by the SEM micrographs, in compressive tests, the more branched the dendrites, the more shear bands, and the higher compressive strength and plasticity of these composites. In tensile tests of Ti40.5Zr27.9Be15.3Cu6.3Nb10 (x =10), ductile fracture features, including the macroscopic necking, fracture of ligament, vein patterns and sliding traces, are observed. The reason of the excellent mechanical properties of the measured composites is that the propagation of shear bands and cracks are impeded by \u00ce\u00b2-Ti(Zr, Nb) dendrites, and then be confined in a small space.",

Here we present that hardness of deformed Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 bulk metallic glass (BMG) exhibits an initial decrease and a subsequent increase with plastic strain. This extraordinary variation of hardness was studied by investigating evolution of shear band intersections and free volume with plastic strain. As plastic strain increases from 6% to 83%, the density of shear bands increases from 0.04 to 0.92\u00c2 \u00ce\u00bcm\u00e2\u0088\u00921. Meanwhile, the distribution width of shear band spacings gradually narrows, and the number of intersections between shear bands increases. When plastic strain is larger than 47%, the number of intersections increases faster. Free volume in the deformed BMG at room temperature increases with plastic strain increasing from 6% to 83%. Both free volume induced softening and shear band interaction induced hardening may affect the hardness of the deformed BMG. In the plastic strain range of 0%\u00e2\u0080\u009347%, free volume induced softening mainly contributes to the initial decrease in hardness with plastic strain. In the plastic strain range of 47%\u00e2\u0080\u009383%, shear band interaction induced hardening may lead to the increase in hardness with plastic strain, after counteracting free volume induced softening.",

            "The impact resistance of fibre-reinforced composites is vital in many applications, and can be improved by exploiting synergies in fibre-hybridisation. These effects are however not sufficiently well understood in the literature. Penetration impact tests were hence performed on carbon/glass hybrids, and the results were linked to the flexural behaviour and translaminar fracture toughness. The results revealed large synergetic effects of up to 40% compared to the linear rule-of-mixtures. The results are also the first to reveal that creating a translaminar fracture surface can strongly contribute to the energy absorbed during penetration impact: 56% for an all-carbon fibre composite and 13% for an all-glass fibre composite. These results prove that strategies for maximising the translaminar fracture toughness can also be exploited to maximise the penetration impact resistance of fibre-hybrids. In carbon fibre composites in particular, ply blocking, using larger yarns and introducing micro-cuts should therefore increase the penetration impact resistance.",

EBSD indicates formation of an ultrafine grained (UFG) structure within a size range of 632nm in FGSD in comparison to 727nm in CGSE which is attributed to more significant grain fragmentation in the FGSD sample with higher surface area of boundaries. In both as-annealed and -deformed conditions, hardness, yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the CGSE samples are higher than those of FGSD which is attributed to more significant solute enrichment. Elongation is found to reduce by the initial passes of ECAP and gradually improve by further processing. At a similar deformation history, the uniform elongation of the deformed CGSE samples is higher than those of the deformed FGSD samples which is attributed to more significant solute enrichment and work hardening causing a delayed necking and larger uniform elongation. However, the elongation to failure of FGSD samples after 2, 4 or 6 pass ECAP is larger than the CGSE sample with a similar deformation history which may be due to the high capacity of boundaries to accommodate dislocations and postpone fracture.",

The glasses are studied in order to determine the influence of SrO addition on the structural and physical-chemical properties. Density, glass transition and crystallization temperatures increase with SrO content, showing the shrinking and reticulation of phosphate network. The chemical durability of the glass series is enhanced by the substitution of Na2O and P2O5 by SrO. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and 31P Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies revealed the depolymerisation of the glass network by the decrease of middle chain units to create end chain units species. Calorimetric study of the dissolution of glasses in acid solution shows a decrease of the dissolution enthalpy when the SrO is added.",

            "In anticipation of using fluctuations in the nuclear dipolar and quadrupolar interaction as a probe of lithium ion motion in lithium borate glasses, the static values of these interactions were measured using a variety of echo techniques. The static quadrupolar echo spectrum of 7Li and a calculation of the dipolar interaction in crystalline Li2B4O7 (same chemical composition as the glass under study) were used to estimate the strength of the two interactions. These indicate that the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for 6Li will be of similar size and the dipolar interaction will be dominated by the unlike spin interaction between the 6Li and the 10B, 11B spins. An appropriate theoretical model is proposed and explicit expressions for the echo amplitude are calculated in terms of the dipolar and quadrupolar second moments. This single spin model takes into account the quadrupolar interaction but treats the dipolar interaction as an effective magnetic field. Experimental results are presented which show the essential validity of the model and measurements lead to reasonable values for the dipolar and quadrupolar second moments. The relative merits of the various echo techniques are discussed.",

The effects of Ti and B are that minor addition increases the tendency of new phases formation, and appropriate addition can suppress the formation of crystalline phases.",

The glass transition temperatures of the GFRP skin and phenolic core were obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Subsequently, the flexural behavior of the GFRP skin and the sandwich beams were assessed with a 3-point static bending test at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 180\u00c2\u00b0C. The results show that the variation trend of the GFRP skin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stiffness from 3-point static bending test is in general agreement with the corresponding storage modulus results from the DMA. The GFRP skin, phenolic core, and sandwich beams retained more than 80% of their mechanical properties at 80\u00c2\u00b0C. Moreover, the flexural behavior of the sandwich beams was governed by the GFRP skins up to 80\u00c2\u00b0C, while the phenolic core played a major part on overall behavior beyond this temperature. The full-composite action between the skin and core was lost due to the disintegration of the phenolic core at high temperature.",

Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and modulus of elasticity of glass fiber-reinforced polymethyl methacrylate acrylic resin were studied with a 3-point load test on 54 intact specimens. Six concentrations of type B glass fiber specimens were prepared (n = 9 per each fiber group). Fractured joint margins were rounded, a 2-mm gap was placed between them, and then they were repaired with autopolymerizing acrylic resin and retested. Results. Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and the stiffness of all joints were significantly lower after the repair. Among the groups tested, the units treated with 1% glass fiber displayed the highest transverse strength before and after repair. Modulus of elasticity of the repaired 1% fiber concentration units was enhanced by approximately 25% over those repaired but untreated with glass fiber (0% fiber). (J Prosthet Dent 1998;80:546-50.)",

In addition to high GFA, the FeNi-based glassy alloys exhibit excellent soft-magnetic properties, i.e., rather low H c of 0.7\u00e2\u0080\u00930.95A/m, high \u00ce\u00bc e of 17,200\u00e2\u0080\u009324,300 and high saturation magnetization of 0.63\u00e2\u0080\u00930.82T.

The glass was formed by melt spinning and its devitrification/crystallisation behaviour during isothermal and anisothermal anneals was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry. The results obtained indicated suitability of the above alloy system for the nucleation study. TiB2 grain refiner particles were subsequently added to the melt and the melt-spun ribbons produced were examined using transmission electron microscopy. No \u00ce\u00b1-Al nucleation was detected on the boride particles, while it was systematically observed on hexagonal dendrites present in the glassy matrix, which suggests that Si poisoning of the borides is occurring.

Composite samples were developed using four different processing conditions, by modifying compression pressure and heating temperature. Local variations of fiber volume and porosity fraction were noticed for samples developed in each processing conditions. On the investigated samples, damages were induced by using 35 joule of drop weight impact to investigate the impact resistance of samples with respect to different processing conditions. The damage behaviour and residual flexural strength was characterized using a micro-CT and three-point bending tests respectively. Furthermore, the influence of porosity fraction on the residual flexural strength were investigated.

It was found that the plain-woven fabric reinforced laminate showed a more violent destruction mode (a massive fracture crack) in comparison with the other two. The stitched and the 3D NCF reinforced laminates exhibited a better impact resistance manifested by a higher stress at the failure initiation point, and a slower or totally arrested fracture crack growth.

            "Objective To investigate the load-bearing capacity and failure mode of various types of glass ionomer cement (GIC) under Hertzian indentation, exploring the relationship between the failure behavior and formulation, and examining claims of filler-reinforcement of GIC. Methods Discs 2mm thick, 10mm diameter, 8\u00e2\u0080\u009318 replicates, were fabricated for two filler-reinforced GICs, four unmodified and unreinforced GICs, and four resin-modified GICs, with a dental silver amalgam and a filled-resin restorative material for comparison. Testing was at 23\u00c2\u00b0C, wet, after 7d storage at 37\u00c2\u00b0C in artificial saliva at pH 6, using a 20mm diameter hard steel ball and filled-nylon substrate (E: 10GPa). First failure was detected acoustically; mode was determined visually. At least 1/3 of specimens in each case were examined under scanning electronic microscope for corroboration. Results Reinforced and unmodified-unreinforced GICs were indistinguishable by failure load (one-way analysis of variance, P =0.425, overall 260\u00c2\u00b170N) and mode. Failure loads for resin-modified GICs were 360\u00e2\u0080\u00931150N, amalgam \u00e2\u0088\u00bc680N, and filled resin \u00e2\u0088\u00bc1200N. Resin-modified GICs tended to be tougher (incomplete fracture), all others gave complete fracture (radial cracking). The stronger materials (two resin-modified GICs and filled resin) showed some cone cracking. Significance While resin-modified GICs showed various extents of increase of failure load over that of the plain GICs, consistent with the hybrid chemistry, filler-reinforcement was not evident for the two claimed products, consistent with structural and theoretical expectations.",

Detailed optical spectroscopic studies of the glassy material were carried out in the UV\u00e2\u0080\u0093Vis-NIR spectral range.

Direct microscopic observation confirmed strict surface crystallization for all studied composition. Compositional evolutions of the viscosity data and microscopically determined crystal growth rate curves have shown that it is the exceptionally high crystal growth rate and crystallization tendency (compared to the minor-to-moderate contribution of viscosity itself) that are responsible for the significant influenceability of the (GeS2)0.1(Sb2S3)0.9 crystallization by the presence of oxygen.",

In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) not much attention has been given to contact between the TiO2 and the transparent conducting glass (TCO), which is used instead of a metal contact to extract electrons. TiO2 layers obtained by microwave-activated chemical-bath deposition (MW-CBD) are proposed to improve TiO2 contact to conducting glass. Spectra of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are obtained for two-photoelectrode TiO2 photoelectrochemical cells. IPCE spectra show higher values when TiO2 double layer photoelectrodes are used. In these, the first layer or contacting layer is made by MW-CBD. Best results are obtained for double layer photoelectrodes on FTO (SnO2:F) as conducting oxide substrate. Modeling of IPCE spectra reveals the importance of electrical contact and electron extraction rate at the TiO2/TCO interface.",

This transition is assumed to be a first-order phase one. The free electron carriers are described with the vector-function representing the second-order parameter responsible for the continuous phase transition.

Furthermore, for the specimens with the same mechanical-testing size, initial free-volume reduction with increasing the casting size of precursory-specimen also led to a degradation of plasticity as higher free-volume was required for higher shear band emission rate.

There is a strong correlation between the lattice parameter and the diffraction peak intensity and all the magnetic changes reported in literature can be explained in terms of this relationship.

The density and ionic concentration of the host sample increased with the introduction of PbI2 halides, whereas the refractive index at 1.55\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c2\u00b5m decreased. The Judd-Ofelt parameters showed that \u00ce\u00a92 increased in PbI2-modified glass, whereas the \u00ce\u00a96 value showed the opposite tendency.

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Metkaolin (MK) and Alkali resistant glass fibers on the performance of SCC. In this study rheological (L-Box, slump flow, T50), mechanical (compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength), and durability (chloride ion penetration and water absorption) properties were investigated. It was observed from the test results there was a reduction in workability with an increase in fiber content. It was found that glass fibers did not impart positive effect on the compressive strength of concrete. The split tensile and flexural strength of glass fibered SCC increased with increase in fiber dosage. The durability studies show that inclusion of GF marginally reduces the resistance to chloride ion and water absorption of concrete. The results show that the presence of both MK and GF in optimal percentages, can improve the mechanical properties and durability of self-compacting concrete significantly.",

Coulombic, polarization, repulsion and realistic strain-energy terms in the interaction potential are considered. It is found that, at very low ion concentrations, the Coulombic term dominates and the activation energy is high, while at high ion contents, the polarization term is dominant and the activation energy is much lower.

The maximum density of the shear bands is observed at the edges of the HPT samples and in areas adjacent to the upper anvils. An increase in strain leads to an increase in the shear bands density.

Thirty-two monolithic crowns were fabricated from IPS e.max Press (M), and the remaining bilayered crowns using cut-back technique and conventional manual layering technique from IPS e.max Press/Ceram (B). Monolithic or bilayered crowns were subjected to single-load-to-fracture (SLF) testing using a universal testing machine, before (M1 and B1) and after exposure to sliding-contact fatigue (SCF) testing (M2 and B2), consisting of 1,200,000 mechanical cycles (F max =98N). Data were statistically analyzed using two-by-two factorial design ANOVA. Fractographic analysis was performed to determine the fracture modes of the failed specimens. Results The mean fracture load values (N \u00c2\u00b1S.D.) for M1, B1, M2 and B2 were 2686\u00c2\u00b1628N, 1443\u00c2\u00b1327N, 2133\u00c2\u00b1578N and 1464\u00c2\u00b1419N, respectively.

Results show that the Ti-based BMGC will be much more sensitive to impurity elements in cryogenic environment than that at room temperature. Besides, the increase in yield strength of BMGCs with the decrease of temperature is not simply due to the dislocations motion in the dendrites becomes more difficult. Low temperature environment can strengthen the glassy matrix as well as increase the strength of dendrites.

This is the second report on the long-term outcome. Methods The enrollment criteria of the trial were as follows: pulmonary peripheral nodule less than 2 cm, diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of clinical T1N0M0 carcinoma with ground-glass opacity and lack of evident pleural indentations or vascular convergence on high-resolution computed tomography. Limited-resection (wedge or segment) specimens were intraoperatively examined by frozen section. If the nodule was confirmed as Noguchi type A or B with a resection margin of greater than 1 cm, the incision was sutured and the patient followed up. The median surveillance period was 10 years. Results In a total of 50 enrolled participants, there were two Noguchi type A, 23 type B and 15 type C adenocarcinomas; five atypical adenomatous hyperplasias, four fibroses, and one granuloma. Although there were no patients with recurrence within the first 5 years, in four patients who underwent limited-resection pulmonary adenocarcinoma developed more than 5 years after the initial resection, of either cut-end recurrence or metachronous primary disease. Conclusions Of 26 patients who underwent limited resection, adenocarcinoma developed in four after more than 5 years. These were possibly cut-end recurrences. We concluded that 5 years is not a sufficient period for follow-up, and that limited resection should still be done only in a trial setting, even for small ground-glass opacity lesions.",

Quantum magnetic material with certain intrinsic functionalities, such as continuously fluctuating spins to the lowest accessible temperature - reminiscing a liquid pattern, is argued to form a new phase of matter. Envisaging a phenomenon where the continuously fluctuating spins are also randomly frozen in space, can diminish the distinction between the two opposite extremes of quantum and classical magnetism. Here, we report new evidence in this regard where the coexistence of quantum spin continuum with a spin glass order in Co-doped CaRuO3 perovskite is demonstrated. In experimental investigations of Co-doped CaRuO3 perovskite, we find that (a) a continuum spectrum in the energy-momentum space, due to the uncorrelated spin fluctuations, persists across the weak spin glass transition at T G \u00e2\u0089\u0083 23\u00c2 K and (b) the quantum fluctuation of magnetic moment is spatially confined to individual sites only, thereby making it an extremely local event. Thus, the fluctuating spins, at a given time, are also randomly frozen macroscopically.

In the materials containing higher amounts of Ca, however, the Al2Ca phase with a lamellar morphology appeared in the microstructure and the volume fraction of \u00ce\u00b2-Mg17Al12 diminished. It was found that Ca generally refines the microstructure and enhances the thermal stability of the alloy. This was documented by the retention of the initial fine dendritic microstructure, hardness, and ultimate shear strength (USS) of the Ca-containing materials after long-term annealing at 673K. The observed improvements are believed to be caused by the solid solution strengthening of Ca in the Mg matrix, and the particle strengthening effects of the thermally stable Al2Ca phase which are formed as an interconnected network. This behavior is in contrast to that of the base material which developed a coarse grain structure with decreased strength and hardness after the same thermal treatment.",

The stronger 2750\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm emission from Er3+: ZFC glass is owing to a stronger covalence and local asymmetry of the crystal field around the Er3+ ions. The low phonon energy (600\u00e2\u0080\u00afcm\u00e2\u0088\u00921) of ZFC glass are calculated from FTIR spectra and confirmed by Raman spectra.

It was evaluated whether the amount of interocular difference in the lens power of the glasses, the type of anisometropia, a history of amblyopia, and the age at the time of the prescription of the first glasses were related to the stereopsis. Results In the anisometropia, the mean stereopsis (seconds of arc) was 77.52 (40-200) in the Titmus-fly test and 52.78 (40-100) in the Randot stereotest. The rate of normal and equivocal stereopsis was 87.7% in the Titmus-fly test and 96.9% in the Randot stereotest. The isoametropic patients demonstrated better stereopsis (52.86 and 39.20 in either test) than did the anisometropic patients (P < .05). The stereopsis was worse in the spherical hyperopic type of anisometropia than in the spherical myopic type (P < .05). The level of stereopsis was not related to the other factors that were investigated. Conclusions The level of stereopsis with the wearing of anisometropic glasses was clinically near normal and the\u00c2 glasses did not seriously affect the binocular vision regardless of the severity of the anisometropia.",

The microstructural, electrical and optical properties of AZO films were investigated in a wide temperature range from room temperature up to 350\u00c2\u00b0C by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Hall measurement, and UV\u00e2\u0080\u0093visible meter. The nature of AZO films is polycrystalline thin films with hexagonal wurtzite structure and a preferred orientation along c-axis. The crystallinity and surface morphologies of the films are strongly dependent on the growth temperature, which in turn exerts a great effect on microstructural, electrical and optical properties of the AZO films. The atomic arrangement of AZO film having an wurtzite structure was indeed identified by the HRTEM as well as the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). The defect density of AZO film was investigated by HRTEM. The film deposited at 100\u00c2\u00b0C exhibited the relatively well crystallinity and the lowest resistivity of 3.6\u00c3\u009710\u00e2\u0088\u00924 \u00ce\u00a9 cm.

The fiber dispersion state was evaluated qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitatively by the fiber distribution index (FDI). Carbon fiber agglomeration is more likely to occur in hybrid composites and was present in the core layer of DFFIM composites in this study. However, glass fiber has shown relatively uniform dispersion in hybrid composites with a greater tendency to be distributed in the skin layers. This is attributed to the difference in feeding method, where glass fibers were fed through the hopper while carbon fibers were inserted from the vent hole. The IFSS between fibers and polypropylene of different composites in different layers is discussed by considering fiber length and orientation distributions in the core and skin layers, respectively.",

We found that in the undoped sample, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition accompanying a semiconductor\u00e2\u0080\u0093metal transition occurs at 70 K. With the increase of Cu content x, the AFM transition temperature decreases monotonously at first. When x \u00e2\u00a9\u00be 0.05 , both the metallic behavior and long-range AFM ordering disappear. Meanwhile, a spin-glass state emerges at low temperatures. The evolution of the transport and the magnetic properties with the Cu content x is summarized and a phase diagram is proposed. Our results indicate that a local spin picture may be more appropriate than an itinerant model for the Fe1.05Te compound.",

The addition of AgI in silver borophosphate glasses affects the mixed glass former effect. FTIR spectra show that the phosphate glass network is continuously modified in the entire compositional range due to incorporation of B2O3.

In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to develop an amorphous coating with Fe48Cr15Mo14Y2C15B6 bulk metallic glass on AISI 4140 substrate by laser surface processing. Following coating, the microstructure and phase aggregate were analyzed by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Microhardness and wear resistance were assessed using Vickers microhardness tester and ball-on-plate wear testing machine, respectively. The coating thickness varied directly with incident laser power and interaction time. Despite trials with wide range of process parameters, the present experiments were unable to retain complete amorphous surface microstructure after laser surface coating. Numerical prediction of the thermal profile and related parameters suggest that the cooling rate and thermal gradient experienced by the coated zone were fairly high. Yet failure to retain amorphous/glassy microstructure of an otherwise bulk metallic glassy alloy suggests that compositional changes (solute redistribution) within the coated zone and across the coating\u00e2\u0080\u0093substrate interface are responsible for nucleation and growth of crystalline phases from the melt.

For mortar specimens, the percentage of substitution of cement (up to 20% by weight) was used to evaluate the applicability of the glass powder in masonry construction. Primarily, several experiments such as thermogravimetric analysis, compressive strength tests, pozzolanic activity and durability tests were carried out to evaluate the potential use of GPR in cement industry. Secondly, to evaluate the eco-efficiency of the material elaborated, the energy demand of cement partially replaced by glass powder residue and the energy performance of mortars were calculated using mathematical equations. The results showed that GPR presents a pozzolanic activity and a free calcium hydroxide cement matrix is obtained when the ordinary Portland cement is partially replaced by 50% by weight of GPR in cement pastes. Moreover, the partial replacement of cement by 10% by weight of GPR leads to an increase of physico-mechanical properties of mortars.

Minor addition of Ga (x\u00e2\u0080\u00af=\u00e2\u0080\u00af2) is beneficial to improve the strength and ductility of the TiZrCuPd-based BMG due to the formation of local structural heterogeneities which facilitate the formation of a highly organized pattern of multiple shear bands under quasi-static compression. Ti40Zr10Cu34Pd14Ga2 BMG shows the best combination of compressive global strain and maximum compressive strength of \u00e2\u0088\u00bc4.5% and \u00e2\u0088\u00bc2000\u00e2\u0080\u00afMPa, respectively. Comparing the Young's modulus of Ga-containing alloys in amorphous and crystalline state we find that the amorphous state shows significant elastic softening (40\u00e2\u0080\u009348% smaller) which is useful to reduce stress shielding effect for biomedical applications. The alloys show a remarkable thermoplastic formability as the viscosity decreases sharply by an order of magnitude in the supercooled liquid region.",

The tunnel oxide was an electrochemical SiO2 layer grown through the pores of the anodic alumina layer. It was demonstrated that this simple MOS structure shows comparable memory characteristics (charging/discharging, memory window and retention) with those of charge trapping type memories using high-k dielectrics in a complicated gate dielectric stack, fabricated using expensive equipment.

The as-cast Zr-based BMG exhibited a greater corrosion resistance in the HCl solution than that of the annealed alloy. The depletion in the Zr and Al cation fractions of the surface oxidation film, which resulted from the precipitation of reactive nanocrystalline phases from the glassy matrix, is responsible for the reduced corrosion resistance.",

            "The fast relaxation in glass-forming substances is often identified with the \u00ce\u00b2-relaxation of the idealized mode coupling theory (MCT), which involves a critical temperature, T c, higher than the glass transition temperature, T g. However, several recent experimental works indicate that the fast relaxation may not be so simply described. These findings include the breakdown of the predictions of the idealized MCT below T c in 0.4Ca(NO3)2\u00e2\u0080\u00930.6KNO3 (CKN) and ortho-terphenyl (OTP), the existence of the fast relaxation also in crystalline OTP, and the flat dielectric susceptibility minimum (i.e., nearly frequency independent or constant loss) observed in CKN and propylene carbonate at temperatures below T c. These experimental facts indicate that the fast relaxation observed below T c is outside the predictions of the idealized MCT and a recent two-component schematic model of MCT, which includes hopping. It is unlikely that this non-MCT fast relaxation existing below T c will abruptly vanish at temperatures above T c. The need for an alternative model of the fast relaxation not only below but also above T c is thus clear. We analyzed susceptibility spectra of many glass-formers with the assumption that the susceptibility minimum is caused by a temperature dependent near constant loss. Good fits to the susceptibility spectra were obtained and in the process the near constant loss was determined as a function of temperature. When compared in a plot against T g-scaled temperature, the near constant losses of different glass-formers exhibited a pattern that correlates with the stretch exponent, \u00ce\u00b2 \u00ce\u00b1(T g), of the Kohlrausch\u00e2\u0080\u0093Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0093Watts (KWW) function which describes the time dependence of the structural \u00ce\u00b1-relaxation at T g. The correlation suggests that the fast relaxation and the slow structural \u00ce\u00b1-relaxation are both determined by the same factor, which we attribute to the anharmonic intermolecular potential of interactions between the molecules. The fast relaxation is suggested to be the relaxation of a vibration by anharmonicity. The vibration is likely the one that attempts to relax the structure of the glass-former.",

The co-doping of Ce3+ ions poisoned the phosphorescence emission of Eu2+ because of the competition to obtain the trapped electron.

Although great efforts have been made, why MGs show better plasticity at low temperature remains unclear. In this work, the shear band cracking and fracture mechanism of a relatively brittle TiZr-based MG was investigated through methods of low temperature compression and 3D X-ray tomography. Pronounced apparent softening and profuse internal shear-band cracks were observed along with the improved plasticity, enhanced yield strength, decreased average softening rate, and reduced area of vein pattern as decreasing the testing temperature. Moreover, the fracture features can be correlated well with the compressive properties; and the true rupture stress that is carried by the still-bonded part of major shear band was found to be very close to the yield strength, demonstrating that the apparent softening should mainly originate from the cracking rather than dilation of shear band. The decreased softening rate can be fitted by a diffusion model, implying reduced atomic mobility and increased cracking resistance. Consequently, the improved plasticity of TiZr-MG at low temperature was attributed to the suppression of instant fracture and the enhanced resistance to shear band cracking, rather than the change of shear band density.",

A nearly fully amorphous rod with 12 mm in diameter can be obtained at an off-eutectic composition near La62Al15.7(Cu,Ni)22.3, while only a 1.5 mm diameter rod can be obtained fully amorphous for the eutectic alloy La66Al14(Cu,Ni)20. A strong dependence of GFA on the composition is observed for these alloys. In addition, formation of a composite (i.e. \u00ce\u00b1La dendrite reinforced glass matrix) in 12 mm diameter cast rods is observed over a wide range of composition, including the eutectic composition. It has been found that the GFA does not correlate well with the extent of the undercooled liquid region (\u00ce\u0094T x) and is not even closely related to the reduced glass transition temperature (T rg). These unusual observations in glass formation and its relation to the skewed eutectic coupled zone have been explained in terms of the competition between the growth of crystalline phases (i.e. eutectic and dendritic phases) and the formation of the amorphous phase.",

Purpose The objective of this study was to record the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced or cast gold post and cores cemented with 3 cements. Material and methods Forty-two single-rooted premolars with standardized weakened roots were endodontically treated and allocated to 6 experimental groups (n=7) defined by the 2 factors investigated: post system and cement. Three groups were restored with glass fiber posts and resin-modified glass ionomer cement, dual-polymerizing resin cement, or chemically active autopolymerizing resin cement. The other 3 groups were restored with cast gold post and cores and the same 3 cements. The cores of the glass fiber post groups were fabricated with composite resin core material. Metal crowns were cemented on the cores in the 6 groups. The entire system was subjected to continuous compression in a universal testing machine, and fracture limit and location (cervical third, middle third, or apical third) were noted. Two-way ANOVA and the Scheff\u00c3\u00a9 test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups (\u00ce\u00b1=.05). Results Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the post type (P<.001) and the cements (P<.001). The interaction between them (P<.001) was statistically significant in the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated teeth. The greatest interaction between post and cement was the glass fiber post with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, followed by the cast gold post and core with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Conclusions The use of a glass fiber reinforced post and resin-modified glass ionomer cement increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth.",

The in situ formation of divalent europium (Eu2+) along with Eu3+ during high temperature synthesis of these glasses under ambient atmosphere has been perceived and was explained through optical basicity model. Frequency down-conversion due to emission of two near infrared photons at around 1\u00ce\u00bcm from Yb3+ ions has been realized upon excitation of Eu2+ ions under 286nm and further enhancement of this frequency down-conversion has been observed upon ceramization of these glasses. The precipitation of BaF2 nano-crystals in glass\u00e2\u0080\u0093ceramics causes reduction of Eu3+ ions to Eu2+ ions resulting in an enhancement in the cooperative energy transfer from Eu2+ to Yb3+.

It has been found that \u00cf\u0087(100K) decreases substantially with increasing hydrogen content. This behaviour is primarily attributed to reductions in the density of the Fermi level electronic states. The form and magnitude of the observed anomalous temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility are in agreement with recent electron interaction theories, which predict quantum corrections to the susceptibility. Hydrogen has been found to influence strongly the quantum-mechanical interference at defects, thus slowing down the spin diffusion and enhancing the susceptibility at low temperature.",

The PET/PEN/PHB ternary copolyester containing equal parts of each of the three components can be obtained at room temperature as a liquid-crystalline glass and as an isotropic glass, depending on thermal history.

Kenaf fibers were used to reinforce cement by fabricating fiber reinforced cement composites that exhibited outstanding mechanical and thermo-physical properties. A considerable interest has arisen in investigating the use of natural fiber to replace synthetic fiber for different composite products to alleviate the environmental impact from the traditional construction materials. In order to evaluate the environmental performances of glass fiber reinforced cement wall panels and kenaf fiber reinforced cement wall panels, this study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on the fiber reinforced cement wall panels between kenaf fiber and traditional glass fiber. The structural function and thermal insulation function of the wall panels were considered as two separate functional units. The LCA results showed that the environmental impact could be significantly reduced using kenaf fiber to replace glass fiber as reinforcement in the cement wall panels in regards to both structural and insulation functions. The major contribution to the environmental impact for the fiber reinforced wall panels was from cement and the production of the cement raw materials.

The data show the power law and the scaled dynamics predicted in recent mode-coupling theories for the glass transition. As expected, the critical behaviour occurs at a temperature much higher than the calorimetric glass transition temperature. The relaxation is found to be considerably stretched despite the high probe frequencies (GHz) and there is no indication of any crossover to exponential decay. This is in contrast to the single relaxation time behaviour expected at short relaxation times/high frequencies in phase-space models and also contrary to the reported general behaviour of simple glass-formers. Comparing with data of ionic glass-formers of similar fragility we conclude that there is no simple relation between nonexponentiality of the relaxation decay and degree of fragility as has been suggested.",

Because the number of studies on the 5d\u00e2\u0080\u00934f emissions of Pr3+ in oxide glasses has been limited, it is worth examining the relationship between the luminescence properties of Pr3+ and the chemical composition of the glass. Herein, we demonstrate the luminescence properties of Pr3+-doped aluminosilicate glasses. Although the internal quantum efficiency is not as high as that of conventional Ce3+-doped glasses, a faster decay (on the order of nanoseconds) is attractive for many different applications. An emissions band can be observed under X-ray irradiation, which differs significantly from photoluminescence. Although the Pr3+\u00e2\u0080\u0093P-codoped samples exhibit higher quantum efficiency than P-free glass owing to a blue shift of the optical absorption edge, the effect of P doping was not observed during X-ray induced scintillation or in the pulse height spectra under 252Cf irradiation.",

The usage of synthetic composite fibers is being increased rapidly. However it is expected that, the continuous applications of these fibers in the aerospace sector may tend to decline in the near future in the light of availability of natural fibers. The semi-natural composite proposed in the present work consists of dragline Spider silk as natural fiber and epoxy as matrix. In the world of natural fibers, Spider silk is recognized as the wonder fiber for its unique combination of high strength and rupture elongation. The orientation of the fiber in the matrix is made with reference to the failure resistance of each orientation. The fracture toughness and fatigue life of Spider silk and S-glass epoxy is analyzed using data from literature and verified by FEM (finite element method) simulations. The fracture toughness, stress-strain behaviour and failure of the Spider silk epoxy composite are compared with that of S-glass epoxy composite. The results show that the Spider silk epoxy composite exhibits higher toughness and lesser failure at high stress levels. Therefore it is concluded that Spider silk epoxy composite could be a better replacement for S-glass epoxy composite for the prospect of potential green composite technology in aerospace industries.",

Those data include the pressure and temperature variation of the electrical conductivity for poly(dimethylsiloxane-ethylene-oxide) complexed with NaCF3COO. In the defect diffusion model, ion transport is controlled by defects and ion motion occurs when the ion is encountered by a single defect. As temperature is lowered or pressure increases, the number of single defects decreases, thus decreasing the ionic conductivity. Further, there exists a pressure-dependent critical temperature, T c, below which single defects do not exist. It is shown how the pressure dependence of the conductivity is controlled by the pressure dependence of T c.

Debonding between the MWCNTs and the matrix appeared to occur in the matrix, away from the actual interface. However, the absence of significant pull-out of broken sections of the MWCNTs during fracture, due to failure of the bridging CNTs being predominantly at the crack plane, indicates that further toughening may be available if this mechanism can be activated.",

Materials and Methods: Stainless steel orthodontic buttons were bonded using composite material under 3 different enamel and setting conditions: 1) conditioned and dry enamel surface, 2) conditioned and precontamination of the enamel surface with blood before bonding, 3) conditioned and immediate blood contamination postbonding and were compared with 3 different enamel conditions and setting for bonding with the glass ionomer cement: 1) nonconditioned and wet enamel surfaces, 2) nonconditioned and blood contamination of enamel before bonding, and 3) nonconditioned and immediate blood contamination postbonding. The brackets were bonded to 109 recently extracted teeth and allowed to set in a moist plastic container for 24 hours. They were subsequently tested in shear mode with a universal testing machine. The maximum bond strength and the site of bond failure were recorded. In addition, the location of the bond failure was studied. Results: Composite was capable of sustaining greater forces than the resin-modified glass ionomer materials. Hence, it took more force to debond a bracket cemented with composite than with resin-modified glass ionomer. The effect of contamination was similar in both of the materials, and the magnitude of the decrease in bond strength was nearly of the same proportion. The postcontamination values were not significantly different from the uncontaminated bond strength for either material. The type of bond failure was significantly different for the different materials, and there were significant differences among the treatment conditions. Conclusion: Composite resin had significantly greater shear strength than resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement. Both materials showed a significant decrease in bond strength when precontaminated with blood. The postcontamination values were not significantly different from the uncontaminated bond strength for either material. \u00c2\u00a9 2003 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 61:206-213, 2003",

Based on the present investigation we suggest that the phase equilibrium in sodium borate glasses is controlled by the rate competition of the nucleation and crystal growth between two immiscible phases rather than those being proposed by the conventional phase diagram. The experimental results show that the sodium-rich phase, after being heat-treated at 500\u00c2\u00b0C, was not Na2O.4B2O3, as indicated by phase diagram. The over-coordination of oxygen atoms in the sodium-rich phase rendered difficulties in the crystallization of the sodium-rich phase with less than 75 mol % sodium oxide. Therefore, the high growth rate of the boron-rich phase can force the residual glass toward much higher concentrations of sodium oxide. According to the NMR measurements, it was found that, after reaching equilibrium, the 15Na2O\u00e2\u0080\u009385B2O3 glass separated into Na2O.9B2O3 and 3Na2O.B2O3.",

For example, Zr-based metallic glass nanopillars exhibit ceramic-like strengths (2.25GPa) and metal-like ductility (25%) simultaneously when the pillar dimension is reduced to <100nm. Here, we report a new compositional design approach to create tough metallic glass composites consisting of micrometre-scale dendrites and nanometre-scale amorphous matrices that exhibit high strength and ductility in the normally brittle MgZnCa metallic glass system.

Thus, the development of simple and low cost woven glass fibre composites with an improvement on their tensile and impact properties is suggested. In this paper, the hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using low cost short silk fibres as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the composite reinforced by the short silk fibre (with the content from 0.3 to 0.6wt%) with a pristine glass fibre composite sample was conducted. Fracture surfaces were analysed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results indicated that the maximum Young\u00e2\u0080\u0099s modulus and ductility index (DI) of a silk reinforced composite increased by 50% and 75%, respectively as compared with the pristine one. Furthermore, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the silk reinforced composite was better than that of the pristine sample as well. According to the results obtained, it was found that the addition of 0.4wt% short silk fibre into glass fibre composite was shown to be the advisable reinforcement content to achieve better tensile and impact strengths.",

            "Sheet molding compounds (SMC) allow to design high performance polymer-matrix composites increasingly used for structural applications in the automotive industry. SMC are usually based on an unsaturated polyester thermosetting resin diluted in styrene with chopped glass fibers and fillers. Due to international regulations linked with the potential risks of styrene, replacing such styrene-based reactive system compound is becoming more and more strategic in order to zero-VOC emission, while keeping similar (or displaying even better) mechanical properties and shrinkage control to conventional SMC-based composite materials. In this study, the same sized E-glass fiber was combined with two different vinylester matrices, a conventional styrene containing resin and a styrene free one. The second type fits more suitable for friendly environmentally purposes as it is based on a dimethacrylate diluent. The objective of this work is focused on interfacial adhesion in both systems as the fiber/matrix interface is a key parameter governing the mechanical properties of the final composite materials. A multiscale analysis was carried out from: i)the fiber scale by measuring the interfacial shear stress by using the microdebonding test; ii)the fibers bundle scale by studying the wettability of fibers by the uncured resin; iii)up to the mechanical characterization of unidirectional SMC composites by measuring the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). As main results, it is demonstrated that the styrene-free composites have a suitable interfacial resistance compared to conventional systems whereas impregnation, i.e. specific fiber sizings which will be more soluble in the resin-dimethacrylate reactive system need to be designed.",

Alloy C, containing the highest Al amount, exhibits the highest values of H and E among all studied alloys.

            "Iron-based metallic glass coatings (denoted as FeWCrNiMoBSiC) were prepared on 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel cylinders by atmospheric plasma spraying at different parameters. The morphology, microstructure, and crystalline structure of as-prepared Fe-based metallic glass coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A Pycnometer and a Vickers hardness tester were adopted to measure the porosity and microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry analysis was conducted to investigate the crystallization behavior of various iron-based metallic glass coatings, and a ball-on-disk tribometer was performed to evaluate the tribological properties of the coatings coupled with silicon nitride ceramic balls under unlubricated conditions. It has been found that the microhardness of iron-based metallic glass coatings increases with increasing plasma arc power, which is related to the degree of melting of feedstock powders and the compactness of as-prepared coatings. Besides, the phase compositions of as-sprayed coatings consist of amorphous structure and limited crystalline structure, and the contents of the amorphous structure and crystalline structure vary with plasma arc power. Moreover, iron-based metallic glass coatings deposited at different plasma arc powers show similar steady-state friction coefficients (0.8\u00e2\u0080\u00930.9), but their wear rate varies with varying plasma arc power. Particularly, iron-based metallic glass coating with next to the highest hardness exhibits the best anti-wear ability, which is the outcome of the compromise between the hardness and brittle fracture as well as abrasive wear of the coatings during sliding process.",

            "The mechanism of room temperature persistent spectral hole burning was investigated using Eu-doped sodium borate glass (35Na2O\u00e2\u0080\u009365B2O3). The concentrations dependence of defect centers on the extent of hole burning was investigated for several Eu concentrations because the mechanism proposed so far are of two types: electron transfer to Eu3+ from Eu2+ and from defect centers in the glass. When the defect concentration increased due to X-ray irradiation, a high-temperature hole burning was observed at a Eu concentration (0.3 mol%); where the phenomenon is not observed in a normal sample without X-ray irradiation. When the Eu concentration was very low (0.1 mol%), a spectral hole was observed only at low temperatures even when the concentration of defect centers became saturated due to X-ray irradiation. Furthermore, a concentration quenching of fluorescence from Eu3+ became obvious at Eu concentrations of more than ca. 1 mol%. Hole burning became obvious at the same concentration. These findings indicate that the mechanism is an energy transfer from selectively excited Eu3+ to adjacent Eu2+ and subsequent electron transfer from Eu2+ to Eu3+. Defect centers in the glass reduce the barrier height of this electron transfer.",

Two configurations with glass mat skins and wool felt cores with different thickness were compared and impact behaviour of both configurations was modelled. It can be suggested that the insertion of two wool felts instead of one in the laminate core would slightly improve their tensile and impact characteristics, less so for flexural ones. However, early occurrence of pull-out and the likely presence of porosity were found to affect the performance of the laminates, especially in terms of the appearance of early damage under impact loading. On the other side, the model proved largely capable of predicting the features of impact hysteresis cycles on these structures, which presented some mechanical complexity due to the tendency of wool fibres to be highly coiled in felts.",

Alkali-activated blast furnace slag (AAS) constitutes an alternative to Portland cement due to high energy and environmental pollution associated with industrial Portland cement. Moreover, alkali activated materials offer a series of higher properties than ordinary Portland cement (OPC), such as better strength and durability behaviour. However, the rheology of these materials has been much less intensely researched. The present study aimed to study the effect of waste glass as activator and as replacement of blast furnace slag on the rheological behaviour of AAS pastes, with a comparison between the rheological parameters and fluidity of these pastes to the same parameters in standard cements (CEM I and CEM III/B). The findings show that AAS paste behaviour of rheology when the activator was a commercial waterglass solution or NaOH/Na2CO3 with waste glass was similar, fit the Herschel-Bulkley model. The formation of primary C-S-H gel in both cases were confirmed. However, the rheological behaviour in standard cements fit the Bingham model.

The effective Bohr magneton numbers P obtained from the Curie-Weiss law are about 4.31, 5.53 and 4.42 for liquid CrTe, MnTe and FeTe, respectively. The large values of P suggest that the d-states of Cr, Mn and Fe ions in these liquid alloys are split into two sub bands of spin up and spin down due to the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction.

When the specially designed specimen was subjected to a uniaxial tensile loading, the in-plane stress distribution along the symmetrical plane was hyperbolic, with the presence of both compressive and tensile stresses. The evolution of deformation in the specimen was found to consist of three stages: the shear band initiation stage (stage I), the shear band multiplication stage (stage II) and the final rapid fracture stage (stage III). In a conventional tensile specimen with uniformly distributed stresses, the specimen fractures (stage III) catastrophically after stage I. However, in the specially designed specimen, the complex stress distributions result in not only more stable shearing processes in stage I, but also the evolution of stage II before stage III, which causes the formation of a large number of shear bands.

            "The present review article discusses the nature and properties of soft atomic motion modes, and their role in anomalous properties, including low-energy dynamical properties, of (nonmetallic) glasses. The basic concept and results of the soft-mode model of anomalous properties of glasses are summarized and discussed. The discussion shows that this model is able, in particular, to give a qualitative and scale description of anomalous dynamic and thermal properties of the glasses at low temperatures and frequencies. In accordance with the general suggestion of solid state theory, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcess\u00e2\u0080\u009d (non-Debye) low-energy excitations are expected to determine the properties under discussion, and the major problem is the description of \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcess\u00e2\u0080\u009d excitations. The present review is aimed at demonstrating that the soft-mode model is able to describe the nature of \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcess\u00e2\u0080\u009d excitations at low temperatures T \u00e2\u0089\u00aa T D \u00c2 and low frequencies \u00ce\u00bd \u00e2\u0089\u00aa \u00ce\u00bd D , including both very low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) , T \u00e2\u0089\u00b2 1 K , and moderately low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) , 1 K < T < 10 2 K . In fact, an essential contribution to the properties is found to be due to soft-mode harmonic vibrational excitations at moderately low T and \u00ce\u00bd , e.g.,\u00c2 to the boson peak as a universal broad asymmetric peak in inelastic scattering spectra of photons or neutrons, while at very low T and \u00ce\u00bd to be determined by soft-mode nonvibrational excitations like two-level systems. Thus in the model the \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcess\u00e2\u0080\u009d excitations in glasses are soft-mode excitations mainly described by one of the two simplest fundamental systems: strongly anharmonic two-level systems or harmonic\u00c2 oscillators. In this sense an important correlation can be predicted in the model between the properties at very low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) and at moderately low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) in the glasses. This prediction naturally corresponds to a recently found empirical correlation: characteristic dynamic and thermal properties of the glasses at very low temperatures are found to be missing in amorphous materials where no boson peak is found. Additional manifestations of the soft modes in glassy phenomena are also described, which concern the origin of the so called negative-U centres in electron properties of semiconducting glasses and the predicted strong suppression of low-energy properties of glasses at moderately high hydrostatic pressure. Other models of the anomalous properties of glasses can either be considered as the limit case of soft-mode model for very low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) or as relevant for only moderately low ( T , \u00ce\u00bd ) (while not being in terms of soft modes).",

The purpose of conducting these tests is to (1) investigate the hygrothermal aging effects on flexural properties of pultruded fiber reinforced polymer (PFRP) composites, and (2) to establish relationship between flexural strength and flexural modulus and hygrothermal aging time. Based on the results of this study, it was found that: (i) the degradation in both average flexural strength and modulus increases at higher temperatures; (ii) the degradation in transverse flexural strength and modulus is relatively higher as compared to those observed for longitudinal flexural strength and modulus; and (iii) the reduction in average flexural strength and modulus for specimens exposed to fresh water and artificial seawater environments is relatively small. The long-term hygrothermal aging effects on flexural properties of PFRP laminates, including temperature variation during exposure, were predicted using both Phillips equation and Arrhenius relationship. The predicted flexural strength, flexural modulus and coefficient \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\u00e2\u0080\u009d agreed well with experimental results.

The results showed that the samples possess favorable near-infrared fluorescence and the 0.9\u00e2\u0080\u00afmol% sample is the best one among these glasses. The emission peaks at ~1180, ~1150 and ~1250\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm can be observed when excited by 500, 700 and 800\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm.

In order to design robust composite structures, it is important to understand the strain-rate-dependent behavior of composite materials. In this study, influence of strain rate on the tensile properties of glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy and hybrid (glass-carbon/epoxy) composites are experimentally and theoretically investigated in the range of strain rates from 0.0016\u00c2 s\u00e2\u0088\u00921 to 542\u00c2 s\u00e2\u0088\u00921. Drop mass setup is used for high strain rate tests. Quasi-static tests are performed on Instron universal testing machine in accordance with ASTM D638. The results indicate that the tensile strength and tensile modulus of GFRP and hybrid composites increase and percentage of failure strain for GFRP, CFRP and Hybrid composites decreases with the increase in strain rate, whereas tensile strength and tensile modulus of CFRP composites remains approximately constant. The scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing the failure modes of the failed region (surface) of the tested specimens. Non contact DIC system is used to capture the strain field with the help of high speed camera.",

            "Upconversion of 800 nm excitation in erbium doped fluoride glasses results in a strong green emission and a weak red emission. The origin of the red emission is elucidated. For fluoride glasses with an erbium concentration up to about 1 mol% it originates from the nonradiative relaxation of the green emitting 4S 3 2 level to the red emitting 4F 9 2 level. This results in a quadratic dependence of the red emission intensity on the excitation power, P ex. For glasses with an erbium concentration higher than 1 mol% the population of the red emitting level is mainly due to a cross-relaxation process between two erbium ions; one in the 4S 3 2 and the other in the 4I 9 2 state. In this case the red emission intensity depends on (P ex ) 3 2 .",

This chapter presents an experimental investigation to determine the effect of dynamic loading from underwater shock waves on damage to GFRP laminates. Two types of GFRP laminates were studied with a relatively low (29%) or high (41%) volume content of E-glass fibers, representative of naval materials made using two manufacturing processes. The GFRP laminates were subjected to shock waves of increasing intensity by increasing the mass and/or reducing the standoff distance of the explosive charge. Blast damage to the laminates initiated with fiber\u00e2\u0080\u0093matrix interfacial cracking and matrix cracking, although a higher shock wave pressure was required to initiate this damage in the composite with the higher fiber content. Blast loading also caused the initiation and growth of delamination cracks; and again the laminate with the higher fiber content displayed superior damage resistance. The laminates eventually ruptured due to fracture of the glass fibers and plies, with the composite with the higher fiber content requiring a greater shock wave pressure to cause complete fracture. Due to the superior blast damage resistance of the laminate with the higher fiber content, the postblast mechanical properties were higher than the composite with the low fiber content.",

The wear resitance of the composite coatings was firstly increased and thereafter decreased with the increase of additive Ti, and was improved by 25.9%, for 4.8wt.% Ti addition. The abrasive mechanism of the composite coatings after adding Ti was the abrasive wear. Thus, it can be concluded that adding Ti effectively promotes the formation of TiN and VC particles to improve the wear resistance of the composite coatings.",

            "Machining is an essential process for manufacturing high precision bulk metallic glass (BMG) components. It requires a fundamental understanding of the BMG chip deformation behaviors and their underlying mechanisms. In this study, chip deformation in orthogonal cutting of zirconium (Zr)-based BMG was investigated. A series of cuts was obtained to analyze morphological characteristics of chip and its related cyclic force. Further, the shear yielding stress, temperature, and strain rate during cutting were evaluated. By analyzing the separation of chip-workpiece and the fracture of chip, the formation mechanism for BMG chip was revealed. Based on the improved Atkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model, the energy consumption in chip formation was calculated, and its relations to chip morphology were discussed. The results showed that BMG cutting produced serrated chip. Individual chip segment deformation involved the formation of the primary shear zone (PSZ) and the secondary shear bands (SSBs). The fracture of the PSZ was found to be responsible for chip serration, and the SSBs were involved in the enhancement of the material plasticity. During low-speed cutting, the PSZ experienced high temperature (>995 K) and high strain rate (>2400 s\u00e2\u0088\u00921). An increase in cutting speed or depth of cut led to the increase in the temperature and strain rate; however, reduced the shear yielding stress. The serrated chip formation is attributed to the fact that two cracks originated from the chip root and the free surface of the chip, which propagated face to face along the PSZ, eventually leading to the fracture of the PSZ. The generated serration energy accounted for the maximum cutting power during chip formation, while the elastic deformation energy within the PSZ accounted for the least. Increasing depth of cut led to an increase in generated serration energy. Increasing cutting speed resulted in significant increase in friction work at tool-chip contact interface, exacerbating chip material deformation.",

It was observed that, while the glass transition temperature T g decreased as expected with increasing plasticizer content, a small portion of the sample appeared to be resistant to the plasticizer. This was manifest in the appearance of a second T g corresponding to the unplasticized sample which remained unaffected by addition of plasticizer. The ageing behaviour of the samples was also examined using enthalpy relaxation measurements and it was observed that the presence of plasticizer accelerates the ageing process, probably due to the fact that there is greater mobility of the chains in the plasticized samples.",

Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the growth of nanocrystals with an average diameter of ~5.0\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm. Shifts in X-ray diffraction peaks with increasing x indicated substitutional inclusion of Cr ions (occupying Bi sites - CrBi) in the Bi2Te3 structure.

Relatively low efficiency in large size cell is also one of the factors that delayed the entry of this type cells in commercial market. Performance of large size DSSCs is always poor than small size cells because of high resistive losses associated with transparent conductive glass substrate.

For long-term stability, to protect corrosion of silver grids in electrolyte environment and to avoid charge recombination between silver grids and electrolyte, silver grids were overcoated by glass frit layer.

Our investigations are for the diagonal correlators \u00ce\u00bb = \u00ce\u00bb\u00e2\u0080\u00b2.

AlN was found to promote further densification of the SiC ceramics due to its evaporation over 1800\u00c2\u00b0C, transportation, and solidification in the pores resulted from SiC grain coarsening.

Materials and methods Specimens of conventional GIC (RIVA, Self-cure, SDI) were prepared in a bipartite Teflon mold and randomly assigned (n=12) to G1- GIC+Single Bond 2 (SB2) (3M-ESPE); G2- GIC+Acid etching (AE) (37% phosphoric acid, Condac, FGM) + SB2; G3- GIC+Single Bond Universal (SBU) (3M-ESPE); and G4- GIC+AE+SBU. The adhesive systems and the composite (Filtek Z350XT, 3M-ESPE) were inserted into the mold. After 7 days stored in a humid environment, the specimens were sectioned into five slices (Isomet 1000, Buehler). Hourglass slices were trimmed and subjected to microtensile bond strength testing (BISCO\u00c2\u00ae; Schaumburg, USA) with 0.5mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (SPSS 17.0, \u00ce\u00b1=5%). Results The microtensile bond strength (MPa) means (standard deviation) were G1=9.46(3.79), G2=6.27(3.21), G3=9.35(3.91), and G4=10.13(3.53). G2 differed significantly from the other groups (p<0.001). G1, G3 and G4 were not significantly different from each other (p>0.05). There were 83% mixed fractures, 9.5% cohesive and 7.5% adhesive. Conclusion GIC etching promoted higher microtensile bond strength with universal adhesive than with a total-etch adhesive system. Acid etching is not necessary to enhance the universal adhesive bond strength and negatively affected the bond strength of the total-etch adhesive system. Without etching the GIC, there is no difference in microtensile bond strength between the adhesive systems.",

The excellent compressive properties were mainly attributed to the inhibition for the propagation of shear bands by the ductile crystals and deformation induced martensitic transformation of the B2-CuZr phase. However, no obvious global tensile ductility was obtained, due to the mode I fracture toughness and small plastic-zone size of glass matrix. To uncover the shear-band evolution during deformation, finite element simulation was conducted, revealing that the ductile B2 phase can tune the shear-stress distribution and consequently initiate and retard shear bands, which stimulates the multiplication of shear bands.

Microstructure of the as-cast rods were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscope in the composites state with microscale Al3Zr particles embedded in the amorphous matrix. Deformation results show that the stress\u00e2\u0080\u0093strain behaviors of the bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) are strain rate and temperature dependent. In addition, SEM observations reveal that the initially spherical and randomly distributed microscale particles in the amorphous matrix deform to concave polygon in shape and align perpendicular to the load direction during the compression. Meanwhile nano-crystals precipitate continuously from the matrix and aggregate during deformation. Rheological analysis show that the BMGCs exhibit a transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian in flow behavior dependent on the stain rate. Particles in the amorphous matrix have reinforcement effect on the BMGCs, but the deformation behavior is still dominated by the homogeneous flow of the amorphous matrix phase.",

The vertically aligned CNTs (VACNTs) were patterned with a honeycomb configuration using photolithography and characterized using field emission (FE) applications. Owing to the electric field concentration, the FE current density of VACNTs with honeycomb configuration was higher than that of the un-patterned VACNTs. Ti was coated onto the VACNT surface utilizing the relatively lower work function property to enhance the FE current density. The FE current density reached up to 7.0mA/cm2 at an applied electric field of 2.5V/\u00ce\u00bcm. A fluorescent screen was monitored to demonstrate uniform FE VACNTs with a honeycomb configuration.

A new analyzing technique has been employed in which the full shape of the Brillouin spectrum was compared with a general hydrodynamic theory that has been modified to include non-exponential relaxation. The relaxation is found to be considerably stretched and time-temperature scaling is obeyed. This is by contrast with the reported crossover towards exponentially decay at high frequencies/high temperatures which has been observed previously with Brillouin scattering in other fragile systems such as glass-forming ionic liquids and ionic aqueous solutions. Such a crossover is also expected at sufficiently high temperatures both in mode-coupling and recent geometric phase-space percolation theories. It is concluded that there is no simple relatition between the non-exponentiality of the relaxation and the degree of fragility as has been suggested.",

It is therefore essential to investigate these materials under representative loading cases and to understand their fatigue behaviour (wet and dry) in order to predict their lifetime in service and their likely mechanisms of failure. This paper investigated the dry and wet flexural fatigue behaviour of PCL/PGF composites with 35% and 50% fibre volume fraction (Vf). Significantly longer flexural fatigue life (p\u00c2 <\u00c2 0.0001) and superior fatigue damage resistance were observed for In-situ Polymerised (ISP) composites as compared to the Laminate Stacking (LS) composites in both dry and wet conditions, indicating that the ISP promoted considerably stronger interfacial bonding than the LS. Immersion in fluid (wet) during the flexural fatigue tests resulted in significant reduction (p\u00c2 <\u00c2 0.0001) in the composites fatigue life, earlier onset of fatigue damage and faster damage propagation. Regardless of testing conditions, increasing fibre content led to shorter fatigue life for the PCL/PGF composites. Meanwhile, immersion in degradation media caused softening of both LS and ISP composites during the fatigue tests, which led to a more ductile failure mode. Among all the composites that were investigated, ISP35 (35% Vf) composites maintained at least 50% of their initial stiffness at the end of fatigue tests in both conditions, which is comparable to the flexural properties of human cortical bones. Consequently, ISP composites with 35% Vf maintained at least 50% of its flexural properties after the fatigue failure, which the mechanical retentions were well matched with the properties of human cortical bones.",

In order to investigate the influence of glass fibre content, temperature and strain rate, we carried out a series of uniaxial tensile loadings on an unfilled polyamide and glass fibre reinforced polyamide with different weight fractions: 15, 30 and 50wt%. Experimental results showed that the studied composite is a strain rate, temperature and fibre volume fraction dependant material. Both elastic modulus and tensile strength increase with strain rate and decrease with temperature. Glass fibre reinforced PA66 exhibits improvement in its mechanical strength. The evolution of the normalized modulus and tensile strength as functions of relative density can be described by a type of power function.

Fracture behavior of chopped glass fiber reinforced polymer concrete was investigated in this study using the two-parameter model, according to RILEM recommendations. This is a direct method to calculate the flexural modulus of elasticity and two size-independent fracture parameters, i.e., the critical stress intensity factor, K IC, and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD). Beams with a central notch were tested under three-point bending using an attached clip gauge to measure the CTOD. The chopped glass fibers used were 6 and 25 mm long. The fibers were also pre-treated to improve the adhesion between fibers and resin and fracture properties. In general, addition of fibers increases flexural strength and fracture properties of polymer concrete. The modulus of elasticity of glass fiber polymer concrete can increase by up to 39%.

Of particular concern are under-the-hood thermoplastic parts that are required to be functional at elevated temperatures (around 80\u00c2\u00b0C) encountered in and around the engine. The thermoplastic oil pan, for example, is subjected to the heat created by the engine, which is transferred via its connection by contact, the circulating oil and the surrounding air.

In addition, their yield strength increased with Fe addition, thus the specific strength was enhanced from 3.98\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af105\u00e2\u0080\u00afN\u00e2\u0080\u00afm/kg to 4.46\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00c3\u0097\u00e2\u0080\u00af105\u00e2\u0080\u00afN\u00e2\u0080\u00afm/kg, providing the most optimal scheme of specific strength and GFA among the reported Ti-based BMGs. The developed BMGs exhibited high pitting potentials in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, which were 1.8~2.8 times higher than that of 304 stainless steel. The present result shows that the developed Ti-based BMGs containing high Ti content, combined with high specific strength, large glass forming ability and good corrosion resistance, are promising for applications requring lightweight alloys.",

Experimental results showed that the MRR increases linearly with the increase of abrasive concentration and reaches to the maximum when the abrasive concentration is 20wt.%, and then tends to be stable. When the abrasive concentration increases from 2 to 5wt.%, the MRR per particle increases greatly and reaches a peak. Then the MRR per particle decreases almost linearly with the increase of the abrasive concentration. The root mean squares (RMS) roughness almost decreases with increasing particle concentration. In addition, in situ coefficient of friction (COF) was also conducted during the polishing process and the zeta potentials of abrasive particles in slurry with different solid concentration were also characterized. Results show that COF value is not related to zeta potential but be sensitive to glass surface conditions in terms of rough peaks in preliminary polishing of glass substrate.",

The XRD analysis confirms single phase cubic spinel structure for all compositions. Lattice constant increases from 0.84195 to 0.84429nm with the increasing Mn content and obeys Vegard's law. The average grain size increases by increasing both Mn content and sintering temperatures. Room temperature saturation magnetization increases for x=0.1 and decreases for increasing Mn content. The coercivity decreases with increasing Mn content due to the decrease of anisotropy constant. A reentrant spin glass behavior of these samples is observed from the zero field cooled magnetization measurements. The real part of the initial permeability increases by increasing both Mn content and sintering temperatures. This is due to the homogeneous grain growth and densification of the ferrites. The highest initial permeability 137 is observed for x=0.4 sintered at 1573K on the other hand, the highest relative quality factor (2522) is obtained for the sample Co0.2Mn0.3Zn0.5Fe2O4 sintered at 1523K.

            "Compared to crystalline metals, metallic glasses (MGs) show an exceptional feature of improved ductility after being mechanically processed by wire drawing. However, its underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, with the aid of atomistic simulations, wire drawing and subsequent tensile loading were performed on MG nanowires to systematically investigate the deformation mechanisms of MGs in wire drawing, the deformation-induced heterogeneities and their influences on the tensile ductility. The results revealed that the deformation mechanisms of MGs in wire drawing are closely associated with the area reduction ratio (R): at a small R of 4.7%, the area reduction is realized via shear transformations of atoms near the surface, leaving the core intact; while at a large R of 9.3%, it relies on the formation of multiple spatially distributed shear bands that redistributes the plasticity throughout the sample. The deformation-induced heterogeneities were understood through the detailed analysis of the resultant residual strain and stresses, the gradient rejuvenated amorphous structures, the unique free volume distribution and spatially distributed shear bands. Moreover, the tensile simulations revealed improved ductility synchronized with decreased yield strength of the drawn samples. The improved ductility is attributed to the synergistic effects of three beneficial factors: 1) The surface compressive residual axial stress leads to a shift of the yield sites from the surface to the core, suppressing the rapid formation of shear bands; 2) The rejuvenated structures near the surface constrain and accommodate the plastic deformation in the core; 3) The spatially distributed shear bands, generated at large R, serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for highly dispersed plastic shearing. The findings provide a comprehensive elucidation of the deformation-induced heterogeneities of MGs in wire drawing and establish a physical relationship between these heterogeneities and mechanical properties, which can serve to interpret the experimental results.",

An efficient near-infrared down-conversion mechanism was observed in these samples, involving the emission of two near infrared photons (at around 978\u00e2\u0080\u00afnm) after the absorption of one photon in the ultraviolet-blue region. This effect occurred by means of a process of cooperative energy transfer (CET) from Te4+ to Yb3+ ions. The CET efficiency (\u00ce\u00b7 CET ) was calculated from radiative transitions (lifetime) and also by a new method, developed in this work, based on rate equations quantifying the non-radiative transitions (thermal effect) involved in the system. The two methods showed very good agreement, with \u00ce\u00b7 CET between 82 and 100% obtained for the sample prepared using a higher Yb3+ concentration (4\u00e2\u0080\u00afmol%).

In comparison with the as-cast composite, the as-extruded composite presented a much higher flow stress without sacrificing plasticity under dynamic compression, exhibiting ductility increment, but evidence of work softening was observed. The specimen for the as-extruded composite failed by axial splitting with occasional shear fracture in some regions. It is suggested that the increase in flow stress and ductility of the as-extruded composite is attributed to the extrusion process which introduced hardened condition and texture in the tungsten phase as well as the 3D net structure of the porous tungsten phase.

Comparing the effect of various oxide additions to molybdenum, a correlation between the percentage of ionic bonding character of the oxide and the recrystallization temperature of the ODS-Mo could be found, owing to particle refining during deformation and heat treatment. For hard glass sealing the particle multiplication factor should be as high as possible (e.g. Mo-La2O3) in order to achieve ductility after the pinch-sealing operation. Quartz glass sealing demands an ESS-ribbon with a recrystallization temperature in the range of 1250 \u00c2\u00b0C. A higher recrystallization temperature leads to higher stresses in the quartz glass (higher risk of quartz cracks), a lower recrystallization temperature results in a reduced yield owing to cracks in the ESS-ribbon. A good adherence between the ESS-ribbon and the quartz glass, which is a prerequisite for a long-term vacuum tight seal, is determined by mechanical bonding, chemical bonding, wettability and surface purity of the ESS-ribbon.

The spectroscopic results show that the investigated glasses are potentially candidates as at 1.3\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00ce\u00bcm and 1.45\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00ce\u00bcm laser host as well as reddish-orange to yellow tunable phosphor. Furthermore, a near-infrared downconversion process gives possibility of using of these materials as luminescent solar concentrators and near infrared lasers.",

Well below the superconducting transition temperature the I-V curves are well described by E/J = \u00cf\u00b1 0 exp[\u00e2\u0088\u0092(J 0/J) \u00ce\u00bc ], with E the electric field and J the current density.

The results at low J are characteristic of a vortex glass and constitute the first direct evidence that the low-temperature state of a disordered superconductor is a vortex glass. The results are at variance with predictions from the theory of collective flux creep. Near the phase transition, both \u00cf\u00b1 0 and J 0 exhibit critical behaviour.",

            "Notch sensitivity, free edge delamination and brittle failure are limiting factors for the wider use of conventional composite laminates. In our previous study, a hybrid layup concept with the different materials blocked together but with dispersed orientations was successfully used to design pseudo-ductile hybrid composites with no free-edge delamination. This study introduces a comprehensive set of designed and characterised orientation-dispersed pseudo-ductile thin-ply hybrid composites to address notch sensitivity, another important limiting factor in conventional composite laminates. Un-notched, open-hole and sharp notched tension tests were performed on three different thin-ply carbon/glass hybrid configurations. The investigated laminates showed a successful pseudo-ductile un-notched behaviour with improved notch-insensitivity and suppression of free-edge delamination that was an undesirable damage mode in previously investigated hybrids with plies of the same orientation blocked together. This notch insensitivity results from subcritical damage in the laminates due to the pseudo-ductile damage mechanisms, i.e. dispersed delamination and fragmentation. These damage mechanisms can eliminate stress concentrations near the notch and suppress the conventional damage mechanisms that govern the notched response of the laminates.",

            "Objectives To evaluate the effects of thermal cycling on the flexural properties of composites reinforced with two differently sized fibers. Methods Acid-washed, woven, fused silica-glass fibers, were heat-treated at 500\u00c2\u00b0C, silanized and sized with one of two sizing resins (linear poly(butyl methacrylate)) (PBMA), cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Subsequently the fibers were incorporated into a polymer matrix. Two test groups with fibers and one control group without fibers were prepared. The flexural properties of the composite reinforced with linear PBMA-sized fibers were evaluated by 3-point bend testing before thermal cycling. The specimens from all three groups were thermally cycled in water (12,000 cycles, 5/55\u00c2\u00b0C, dwell time 30s), and afterwards tested by 3-point bending. SEM micrographs were taken of the fibers and of the fractured fiber reinforced composites (FRC). Results The reduction of ultimate flexural strength after thermal cycling was less than 20% of that prior to thermal cycling for composites reinforced with linear PBMA-sized silica-glass fibers. The flexural strength of the composite reinforced with cross-linked PMMA-sized fibers was reduced to less than half of the initial value. Significance This study demonstrated that thermal cycling differently influences the flexural properties of composites reinforced with different sized silica-glass fibers. The interfacial linear PBMA-sizing polymer acts as a stress-bearing component for the high interfacial stresses during thermal cycling due to the flexible structure of the linear PBMA above T g. The cross-linked PMMA-sizing, however, acts as a rigid component and therefore causes adhesive fracture between the fibers and matrix after the fatigue process of thermal cycling and flexural fracture.",

            "Magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of Ho2PtSi3, a new ternary intermetallic compound with the orthorhombic Ba2LiSi3-type structure, are studied by dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, magnetic relaxation, specific heat, and magnetic memory effect measurements. The experimental results indicate that this system undergoes a magnetic phase transition from a paramagnetic state to a ferromagnetic cluster state at a temperature T C ~ 6.5K followed by a cluster glass transition at T f ~ 5.8K. The typical cluster glass features observed below T f for Ho2PtSi3 include (1) broad peak in specific heat curve, (2) frequency dependent cusp in ac susceptibility curve, (3) evident irreversible magnetism, (4) long-time magnetic relaxation behavior, and (5) zero-field-cooling magnetic memory effect. On the other hand, the large values of magnetic entropy change, relative cooling power and adiabatic temperature change are estimated near T C under a field change. These results suggest that Ho2PtSi3 can be classified as a huge ferromagnetic cluster glass system with large magnetocaloric effect.",

An electrical hot-plate in thermal contact with a steel spiral coil is used to charge the oil/pebble-bed storage under different average charging flow rates. The heat transfer characteristics are presented in terms of the average temperature of the oil, the average temperature of the pebbles, the average charging power and the volumetric heat transfer coefficient. The results reveal that an increase in the average charging flow rate results in a linear increase in the volumetric heat transfer coefficient. An expression for the correlation between the superficial mass flow velocity, the average pebble diameter and the volumetric heat transfer coefficient is also formulated.",
