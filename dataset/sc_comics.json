Quantitative EDS analysis confirms the reduction of Ca content and the increase of Ce one. The variation of resistivity with temperature shows that all samples exhibit a metallic-like character in the normal state.

The highest value of 90.84K is obtained for x=0.075 of Ce content, a result which is in line with that obtained in Y doped series. Also, samples of PCC series are more homogeneous.

Since the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect in metallic multilayers, the first-generation spintronics has generated huge impact to the mass data storage industries. The second-generation spintronics, on the other hand, focuses on the integration of the magnetic and semiconductor materials and so to add new capabilities to the electronic devices. While spin phenomena have long been investigated within the context of conventional ferromagnetic materials, the study of spin generation, relaxation, and spin-orbit coupling in non-magnetic materials took off only recently with the advent of hybrid spintronics and it is here many novel materials and architectures can find their greatest potentials in both science and technology. This article reviews recent progress of the research on a selection of hybrid spintronic systems including those based on ferromagnetic metal (FM) and alloys, half-metallic materials, and two-dimensional (2D) materials. FM and alloys have spontaneous magnetization and usually high Curie temperature (T c), half-metallic materials possess high spin polarization near the Fermi level (E F), and the 2D materials have unique band structures such as the Fermi Dirac cone and valley degree of freedom of the charge carriers. Enormous progress has been achieved in terms of synthesising the epitaxial hybrid spintronic materials and revealing their new structures and properties emerging from the atomic dimensions and the hetero-interfaces. Apart from the group-IV, III-V, and II-VI semiconductors and their nanostructures, spin injection and detection with 2D materials such as graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and topological insulators (TIs) has become a new trend and a particularly interesting topic due to either the long spin lifetime or strong spin-orbit coupling induced spin-momentum locking, which potentially leads to dissipationless electronic transport.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Property", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Property", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Material", "T26": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Material", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Material", "T35": "Material", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Property", "T39": "Material", "T40": "Property", "T41": "Property", "T42": "Property", "T43": "Material", "T44": "Property", "T45": "Property", "T48": "Material", "T49": "Material", "T50": "Material", "T51": "Material", "T52": "Material", "T53": "Property", "T54": "Material", "T55": "Element", "T58": "Property", "T59": "Property", "T60": "Property", "T61": "Property", "T3": "Property", "T62": "Element", "T56": "Element", "T63": "Property", "T64": "Property", "T23": "Property", "T12": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T65": "Property", "T46": "Material", "T47": "Property", "T66": "Property", "T67": "Property", "T13": "Material", "T68": "Material", "T14": "Material", "T57": "Property"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 11], "T2": [70, 74], "T4": [111, 117], "T5": [172, 195], "T6": [197, 200], "T7": [212, 220], "T8": [221, 232], "T9": [255, 266], "T10": [352, 363], "T11": [418, 426], "T15": [493, 503], "T16": [519, 523], "T17": [597, 610], "T18": [611, 620], "T19": [635, 639], "T20": [652, 662], "T21": [668, 678], "T22": [691, 703], "T24": [763, 774], "T25": [801, 810], "T26": [974, 984], "T27": [1018, 1031], "T28": [1032, 1037], "T29": [1047, 1053], "T30": [1055, 1068], "T31": [1069, 1078], "T32": [1084, 1099], "T33": [1105, 1114], "T35": [1123, 1129], "T36": [1147, 1160], "T37": [1197, 1200], "T38": [1203, 1216], "T39": [1217, 1226], "T40": [1240, 1244], "T41": [1245, 1257], "T42": [1267, 1278], "T43": [1297, 1306], "T44": [1319, 1334], "T45": [1400, 1415], "T48": [1510, 1519], "T49": [1544, 1554], "T50": [1614, 1631], "T51": [1675, 1689], "T52": [1700, 1714], "T53": [1716, 1730], "T54": [1753, 1762], "T55": [1771, 1779], "T58": [1937, 1941], "T59": [1961, 1971], "T60": [1989, 2002], "T61": [2055, 2075], "T3": [1101, 1103], "T62": [1781, 1813], "T56": [1815, 1819], "T63": [1280, 1283], "T64": [1294, 1296], "T23": [1750, 1752], "T12": [1178, 1195], "T34": [1825, 1847], "T65": [1849, 1852], "T46": [1588, 1605], "T47": [1347, 1363], "T66": [1116, 1118], "T67": [1039, 1041], "T13": [431, 444], "T68": [445, 454], "T14": [1482, 1491], "T57": [1499, 1509]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "In the last decade the use of interface engineering to generate additional functionalities and to modulate properties has gained considerable attention due to major advancements in thin film technologies for fabrication and characterization at the micro- and nanoscale.

These properties stem from a variety of physical effects, for example, space charge effects and/or strain at the interface, which alter two important characteristics: (i) the local interfacial ionic near order positions and (ii) the local charge carrier density within the oxide volume, that is, the number of available and mobile defects. The change in near order alters actively the ionic migration hopping distances and energies. Compared with previous decades, where a lot of research was dedicated toward the optimization of microstructures and the influence of doping, this opens completely new ways of designing and enhancing materials.

The investigated amount of added Pb was between 1\u03bcgcm\u22122 and 23\u03bcgcm\u22122 with respect to the geometric area of the Pd cathode. The optimum surface doping level 2.9\u03bcgcm\u22122 of Pb (\u223c1.4 mass equivalent monolayers) was found to achieve the highest quantity of inserted hydrogen at approximately \u22120.5V vs RHE.

The results of resistivity indicate that the critical temperatures T c of the samples decrease monotonically with an increase in Y content. Further, the critical concentration of Y to completely suppress superconductivity in the Y-doped Bi (Pb):2223 system is higher (0.60) than that reported (0.20) for the other rare-earth elements. On the other hand, the values of TEP at room temperature are found to be negative for Y=0.00 and 0.10 samples, and it changed to positive with further increase in Y content. The hole-carrier concentration per Cu ion (P) is deduced by using two different ways: the first in terms of T c values in the superconducting state and the other in terms of TEP values in the normal state. Interestingly, it is found that the values of P deduced from the formal way are not consistent with the reported parabolic behavior for superconducting systems in the under-doped region, and consequently disagree with the general roles of substitution. However, the vice versa is recorded for the values of P deduced from the latter way. The results are discussed in terms of the possible reasons for the suppression of superconductivity in the considered system.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "SC", "T3": "SC", "T4": "Characterization", "T5": "Characterization", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Characterization", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Material", "T12": "Property", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Property", "T16": "SC", "T19": "Property", "T21": "SC", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T24": "SC", "T27": "SC", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T34": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Element", "T39": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T53": "Property", "T54": "Element", "T55": "Value", "T56": "Value", "T57": "Element", "T58": "Element", "T59": "Property", "T31": "Element", "T28": "Main", "T13": "SC", "T36": "Element", "T9": "Doping", "T17": "Doping", "T18": "Doping", "T20": "Doping", "T8": "SC", "T25": "Element", "T26": "Element", "T32": "Element"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [4, 14], "T2": [19, 34], "T3": [80, 95], "T4": [124, 141], "T5": [143, 146], "T6": [149, 160], "T7": [206, 209], "T10": [390, 400], "T11": [452, 470], "T12": [507, 518], "T14": [559, 562], "T15": [645, 667], "T16": [696, 713], "T19": [1005, 1017], "T21": [1109, 1112], "T22": [1127, 1142], "T23": [1193, 1205], "T24": [1343, 1358], "T27": [1627, 1644], "T29": [165, 185], "T30": [187, 190], "T34": [309, 310], "T37": [621, 622], "T38": [721, 722], "T39": [729, 741], "T41": [671, 672], "T42": [481, 482], "T53": [860, 863], "T54": [913, 914], "T55": [915, 919], "T56": [924, 928], "T57": [990, 991], "T58": [1036, 1042], "T59": [1175, 1178], "T31": [259, 263], "T28": [49, 79], "T13": [537, 558], "T36": [806, 816], "T9": [324, 335], "T17": [723, 728], "T18": [1380, 1385], "T20": [1446, 1458], "T8": [264, 272], "T25": [343, 347], "T26": [359, 362], "T32": [423, 436]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Target", "R3": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["E1", "T32"], "R3": ["E2", "T39"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T9", "E2": "T17", "E3": "T18", "E4": "T20"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Site", "T25"], ["Dopant", "T26"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T38"]], "E3": [], "E4": []}}, {"text": "We selected polyacrylonitrile (PAN, \u2013[C3H3N]\u2013) as an O-free organic dopant and fabricated C-doped MgB2 wires by in situ and powder-in-tube techniques. 0\u20135 wt.% PAN powders were uniformly mixed with B powder using a liquid mixing method.

For the full characterization of the pure and Eu doped Bi-2223 samples, the degree of granularity (from the bulk density and porosity measurements); the room temperature resistivity, onset\u2013offset critical transition temperature, variation of transition temperature, hole carrier concentration, spin-gap opening temperature and thermodynamic fluctuations (from the dc resistivity experiments); the texturing, crystal structure, crystallite size, phase purity and cell parameters (from the XRD investigations); the variation of the flux pinning centers and the boundary weak-links between the superconducting grains (from the critical current density values); the crystallinity, specimen surface morphology, grain connectivity between the superconducting grains and grain size distribution (from the SEM examinations), the elemental compositions and distributions (from EDX measurements) of the samples are determined and discussed clearly. The results obtained confirm that all the properties degrade with the enhancement of the Eu concentration in the Bi-2223 superconducting matrix up to x =0.5 beyond which they are destroyed surprisingly due to not only the distortion between the Bi-2223 slabs but also the increase in the porosities and grain boundary weak-links. For example; the onset (offset) critical temperature decreases from 117.6K (109.9K) to 68.1K (14.8K) with the impurity content. The critical temperatures ( T c onset and T c offset ) are not measurable for the sample doped with the Eu content level of x =0.7 as a consequence of the metal to insulator transition (MIT). On the other hand, the critical current density (Jct ) is measured in the range from 3201A/cm2 (for the pure sample) to 29A/cm2 (for the sample doped with x =0.5). For the sample doped with x =0.7, each value is not measurable due to the nonsuperconducting behavior. Besides, the SEM pictures display that the surface morphology and grain connectivity degrade considerably with the Eu concentration. Moreover, the XRD measurements show that the Eu inclusions enter into the crystal structure by reducing the formation velocity of the Bi-2223 phase. Similar to the XRD evidences, the EDX measurement results demonstrate that all the elements used in the samples successfully introduce into the Bi-2223 structure, and the observed peaks of Ca, Cu and especially Pb reduce gradually with the Eu individuals in the Bi-2223 matrix, meaning that the Eu nanoparticles may substitute for the elements given above. This is enough to explain why the superconducting properties retrograde rapidly with the Eu impurities.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "Property", "T3": "SC", "T4": "Element", "T6": "Main",

In this technique, the quality of the YBCO thin films is strongly dependent on various processing conditions such as substrate temperature, laser energy density, ambient oxygen pressure, and pulse repetition rate, all of which have been previously investigated. However, it has been also found that the laser target is one of the key factors in the fabrication of high-quality YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (YBCO) thin films. In the systematic identification of this effect, nine different YBCO targets have been studied. Both the YBCO targets from various sources and the corresponding YBCO thin films deposited under optimized conditions have been characterized and compared by their structure, composition and electronic properties. This investigation has indicated that impurity phases (liquid phase, 211 and CuO) in the targets play different roles, though the sintered targets as a whole were stoichiometric. The superconducting transition temperature (T c) of YBCO thin films decreased as the liquid phase (BaCuO2\ue5f8CuO, which is yttrium deficient) in the YBCO bulk target increased. T c of the thin films may also be decrease with the presence of the 211 phase in the targets, however, the CuO phase in the YBCO target may actually increase T c of the thin films.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Process", "T2": "SC", "T3": "Material", "T4": "Material", "T6": "Process", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Process", "T11": "Material", "T12": "SC", "T13": "SC", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Material", "T17": "SC", "T18": "Material", "T19": "SC", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Element", "T25": "Element", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Element", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Main", "T34": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Material", "T38": "Material", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Material", "T35": "Element"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 23], "T2": [105, 120], "T3": [126, 136], "T4": [181, 191], "T6": [315, 323], "T7": [534, 544], "T8": [712, 722], "T9": [911, 917], "T10": [986, 994], "T11": [1019, 1033], "T12": [1039, 1077], "T13": [1079, 1082], "T14": [1092, 1102], "T15": [1120, 1132], "T16": [1186, 1190], "T17": [1209, 1212], "T18": [1220, 1230], "T19": [1367, 1370], "T20": [1378, 1388], "T21": [176, 180], "T22": [610, 614], "T23": [1181, 1185], "T24": [1087, 1091], "T25": [515, 526], "T27": [528, 532], "T28": [707, 711], "T29": [933, 936], "T30": [1277, 1286], "T31": [1316, 1325], "T32": [1333, 1337], "T33": [121, 125], "T34": [308, 314], "T36": [651, 655], "T37": [255, 264], "T38": [894, 909], "T39": [1134, 1144], "T40": [1155, 1162], "T41": [1163, 1172], "T35": [925, 928]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "With recent advances on the performance of the YBCO coated conductor (CC) tape, its attractive perspectives for application have opened up for us. Joining process of CC tapes is inevitable for development of coated superconductor based apparatuses where single tape is not long enough or needs to be looped. Generally the joint was completed at a certain temperature and under a constant pressure that were investigated in prior literatures. Because the CC tape is very thin, and easy to damage because of deformation in some region of the tape, the surface of the joint making table should be flat and smooth enough, which have not received serious attention yet. Meanwhile, the smoothness of the pressing table is crucial to obtain the joint with low resistance. In this paper, a simple and effective joint of coated superconductor tapes making process depending on a soldering table with high smoothness less than 5 \u03bcm/100 mm was investigated. In the process, the non-superconducting lapped joint method with face-to-face configuration was employed, and the solder layer thickness and the joint lapped length varied. The current-voltage characteristic of the jointed tapes was measured in liquid nitrogen bath by a standard four-probe technique. The joint with sufficiently low resistance of 6.3 n\u03a9 was easily achieved with a lapped length of 14 cm, which is ascribed to the use of a soldering table with high smoothness. In addition, the joints microstructure was observed by the metallographic microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to reveal the distribution of the solder between the joined CC tapes.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Material", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Process", "T6": "SC", "T8": "Process", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Process", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Process", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Process", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Material", "T19": "Process", "T21": "Material", "T22": "Characterization", "T23": "Characterization", "T24": "Process", "T25": "Process", "T26": "Material", "T1": "Material", "T28": "Value", "T29": "Value", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Value", "T18": "Value", "T20": "Main", "T27": "Material", "T32": "Characterization", "T33": "Property", "T35": "Material", "T3": "Characterization"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [70, 72], "T4": [166, 168], "T5": [208, 214], "T6": [215, 229], "T8": [379, 396], "T9": [454, 456], "T10": [550, 557], "T11": [812, 818], "T12": [819, 833], "T13": [870, 879], "T14": [967, 986], "T15": [1061, 1067], "T16": [1068, 1073], "T17": [1192, 1198], "T19": [1387, 1396], "T21": [1449, 1463], "T22": [1514, 1542], "T23": [1544, 1547], "T24": [1583, 1589], "T25": [1602, 1608], "T26": [1609, 1611], "T1": [52, 68], "T28": [917, 921], "T29": [922, 928], "T30": [1199, 1207], "T31": [1295, 1301], "T18": [1346, 1351], "T20": [47, 51], "T27": [254, 265], "T32": [1227, 1247], "T33": [1277, 1291], "T35": [1329, 1342], "T3": [1499, 1509]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Ag added bulk FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples Ag x (FeSe0.5Te0.5)1\u2212 x were prepared by solid-state reaction.

Correspondingly, the surface morphologies significantly vary with the Cu-doping. In particular, it is found that increase in Cu content changes the ground state from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic (FI) phase and the magnetic transition temperature gradually decreases within the testing temperature ranges, which is mainly attributed to the competition between FI and AFM interactions with increasing Cu-doping content.

The flat bands are originated from the orbital interactions of the Kagome lattices, while the Dirac bands are related to the carbon zigzag chains.

Consistent explanations for significant HTSC properties can be explained without any additional assumptions while retaining valuable insight for geometric interpretation. Combining these two chemical principles with a review of Crystal Field Theory (CFT) or Ligand Field Theory (LFT), it becomes clear that the two oxidation states in the conduction planes (typically d8 and d9) belong to the most strongly divergent d-levels as a function of deformation from regular octahedral coordination.

All materials showed resistivity saturation effects at the highest temperatures. A \u201cparallel resistivity\u201d saturation model could be fitted to all data with excellent results if Mott-Fermi smearing, expected for a transition metal, was included by adding a term in T 3 to the phonon-induced resistivity. However, in the standard saturation model the fitted resistivity parameters were not always realistic. A modified saturation model which partially retained Matthiessen's rule could be fitted equally well and gave numerically acceptable results for both residual, electron-phonon and saturation resistivities. This new model also fitted the T dependence of the pressure coefficients with a single set of coefficients, each valid for all three materials. Although simple free-electron and Debye models could apparently explain the observed pressure dependence of the impurity and electron-phonon resistivities, a model taking band structure changes with pressure into account showed that the electron-phonon interaction factor of titanium is practically independent of pressure while the plasma frequency has a strong pressure dependence.

The variation of the resistance with temperature for all the films studied, with and without an external DC magnetic field, followed that found by the conventional four-point DC technique. However, the temperature variation of the reactance for these granular thick films showed four important features: (1) for temperatures below T c (R=0) the reactance was purely inductive even when superconductivity had been destroyed by the application of an external magnetic field, but the tail of the resistive transition was still present; (2) high quality, melt textured, thick films had a small double peak (or broad single peak) structure in the inductance for temperatures above T c which corresponded to changes in the tail of the resistivity transition and these peaks are interpreted in terms of magnetic field penetration into the inter- and intra- granular regions; (3) poor quality films and those intentionally doped with Y2BaCuO5 had a constant inductive value extending from low temperatures to a temperature corresponding to the end of the resistive tail; (4) as the temperature is increased beyond the onset of superconductivity the inductive reactance decreased rapidly, for all films studied, to a negative value (i.e. a capacitive reactance) and then decreased approximately linearly for further increases in temperature. The value of the capacitive reactance appeared to depend on the amount of (211) YBCO present in the film.

Tc increased over the next 20years until the discovery in 1973 of Tc =22.3K (optimized to \u224823K a year later) in sputtered films of Nb3Ge. Attempts were made to produce \u2013 via explosive compression \u2013 higher (theorized to be 31\u201335K) transition temperatures in not-stable-at-ambient-conditions A15 Nb3Si. However, the effort to continue the march to higher Tc \u2019s in A15 Nb3Si only resulted in a defect-suppressed Tc of 19K by 1981. Focus in superconductivity research partially shifted with the advent of heavy Fermion superconductors (CeCu2Si2, UBe13, and UPt3 discovered in 1979, 1983 and 1984 respectively) and further shifted away from A15\u2019s with the discovery of the perovskite structure cuprate superconductors in 1986 with Tc =35K. However, the A15 superconductors \u2013 and specifically doped Nb3Sn \u2013 are still the material of choice today for most applications where high critical currents (e.g. magnets with dc persistent fields up to 21T) are required.

In addition, several members of this family present sizable increase in the superconducting transition temperature T c under application of hydrostatic pressure. Motivated by these two results, we propose an effective one-dimensional three-orbital model, whose kinetic energy part, obtained through ab initio calculations, is supplemented by pair-scattering terms, which are treated at the mean-field level. We solve the gap equations self-consistently and then systematically probe which combination of pair-scattering terms gives results consistent with experiment, namely, a superconducting dome with a maximum T c at the right chemical potential and a sizable increase in T c when the magnitude of the hoppings is increased. For these constraints to be satisfied multi-gap superconductivity is required, in agreement with experiments, and one of the hoppings has a dominant influence over the increase of T c with pressure.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Main", "T3": "Element", "T4": "SC", "T6": "SC", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Process", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T12": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "SC", "T17": "SC", "T18": "SC", "T19": "SC", "T20": "SC", "T21": "Process", "T5": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Characterization", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Property"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [127, 147], "T2": [151, 167], "T3": [189, 193], "T4": [200, 215], "T6": [293, 331], "T7": [332, 335], "T8": [357, 377], "T9": [465, 470], "T10": [478, 497], "T11": [516, 525], "T12": [526, 538], "T13": [559, 563], "T14": [607, 617], "T15": [721, 725], "T16": [795, 810], "T17": [831, 834], "T18": [893, 896], "T19": [994, 1011], "T20": [1126, 1129], "T21": [1135, 1143], "T5": [984, 993], "T22": [564, 574], "T23": [726, 736], "T24": [7, 25], "T25": [435, 450], "T26": [94, 109], "T27": [451, 464], "T28": [638, 641], "T29": [848, 866]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Solid-state reaction method was used to synthesize Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca2Cu3O10-\u03b4 (CuTl-1223) superconducting phase and sol-gel method was used to prepare cobalt oxide (Co3O4) magnetic nanoparticles.

Typical two step superconducting transitions due to the inter- and intra-grain contributions, induced from the combined effect of superconducting grains and the inter-granular weak-coupled medium respectively are clearly seen in susceptibility [\u03c7(T)] plots.

The magneto transport measurements \u03c1(T)H of polycrystalline 20 at% Ag doped NdFeAsO0.8F0.2 exhibited the upper critical filed [H c2(0)] of up to 334 T, which is slightly higher than the one observed for pure NdFeAsO0.8F0.2.

Up to 40% Pb substitution, the crystal structure remains essentially unchanged, but the sub-unit cell parameters decrease with an increase of Pb substitution; some extra peaks from the X-ray diffraction patterns could be indexed assuming c=37 A \u030a . The Pb substitution tends to stabilise the high-T c phase transition at 110 K and 95 K even for a wide range of heat treatment conditions due to the increase of Ca and Cu concentration in the superconducting phase.

Furthermore, increasing temperature for the tetragonal compositions (1.4\u2a7d x \u2a7d2), manifest the tetragonal to cubic phase transition. For this series, the transition from tetragonal (I4/m)/to cubic (Fm-3m) shows considerable changes in the composition and temperature dependence of the modes: all the Raman modes show a linear behavior when temperature is increased, then the slope change dramatically indicating the symmetry change from tetragonal to cubic.

A large increase of the FWHM with increasing temperature is observed for all modes in the spectrum, clear transitional effects were observed: the width behaves in a linear way as a function of temperature; when the temperature reached the transition temperature, a drop in the width of this mode was observed.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Characterization", "T2": "Characterization", "T3": "Element", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Main", "T7": "Element", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Material", "T12": "Element", "T13": "Characterization", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Material", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Material", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Characterization", "T26": "Material", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Property", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T39": "Value", "T40": "Value", "T42": "Value", "T43": "Value", "T44": "Value", "T46": "Value", "T47": "Property", "T48": "Property", "T50": "Property", "T51": "Characterization", "T49": "Property", "T54": "Property", "T4": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 17], "T2": [22, 40], "T3": [52, 54], "T5": [68, 79], "T6": [89, 105], "T7": [114, 116], "T8": [118, 120], "T9": [188, 193], "T10": [197, 213], "T12": [260, 269], "T13": [283, 303], "T14": [425, 435], "T15": [436, 448], "T16": [475, 485], "T17": [489, 494], "T18": [495, 511], "T19": [550, 560], "T20": [562, 566], "T21": [571, 576], "T22": [578, 583], "T23": [619, 630], "T24": [635, 657], "T25": [680, 691], "T26": [796, 804], "T27": [817, 827], "T28": [831, 836], "T29": [858, 874], "T30": [914, 936], "T31": [1047, 1063], "T32": [1155, 1163], "T33": [1304, 1326], "T39": [125, 126], "T40": [131, 132], "T42": [368, 371], "T43": [376, 379], "T44": [450, 453], "T46": [458, 459], "T47": [908, 912], "T48": [880, 906], "T50": [1089, 1093], "T51": [308, 321], "T49": [1246, 1269], "T54": [219, 242], "T4": [55, 60]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["E1", "T6"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T4"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T3"]]}}, {"text": "The influence of hydrostatic pressure up to 0.48GPa on the fluctuation conductivity \u03c3 \u2032 ( T ) and pseudogap (PG) \u0394 \u2217 ( T ) of slightly doped HoBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 - \u03b4 single crystals with T c \u2248 62K and \u03b4 \u2248 0.35 is studied with current passing under an angle 45\u00b0 to the twin boundaries.

The increasing precision and reliability of experiments place restrictions on the possibilities. From the beginning Anderson has stressed that the anomalous properties of the normal phase are the key. For example a resistivity which is linear in the temperature is observed in the normal state and this is not compatible with a usual Landau Fermi liquid. Likewise the Hall effect and the infrared optical properties are consistent with those of doped insulators while angle resolved photoemission data shows signs of a nearly half-filled Fermi surface. Such paradoxical behavior can be resolved if one makes an analogy to a strongly correlated system in one dimension. In the one dimensional system, exact solutions show a separation of spin and charge excitations at low energy in contrast to a Landau Fermi liquid.

The goal was to determine synthesis conditions of these potential waste forms to immobilize Tc-99 and to harvest crystallographic, thermophysical and hydrodynamic data. Within these studies, Rietveld structure refinement was applied to allow for crystallographic characterization, while a physical property measurement system (PPMS) was used to determine thermophysical properties.

The X-ray diffraction analysis and structural computer simulations reveal that at low doping levels (x < 0.15) Sn preferentially occupies the Cu(1) site, but gradually goes into both the Cu(1) and Cu(2) site at higher doping levels. The rate of T c suppression caused by Sn doping is significantly slower for low dopant concentrations that for high dopant concentrations, indicating that different mechanisms operate at the Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. The hole concentration, determined by both Hall effect and oxygen content, shows a systematic decrease with the dopant concentration. Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms of the mechanisms of the superconductivity suppression is the reduction of the carrier concentration, which dominates the T c-x relationship at low dopant concentrations. Another mechanism may be the impurity-scattering effect caused by the Sn doping at CuO2 planes which is responsible for the dramatic suppression of T c at high dopant concentrations.

The complexity of the superconductor film formation parallels the complexity of the materials themselves. Making films of these materials requires transporting all the elements in the proper stoichiometry onto the substrates, forming the correct crystal structure and layer stacking sequence, and providing sufficient oxygen to form the superconducting phase. Evaporation of separate metal constituents generally is a low-pressure process. A high oxygen-atom arrival rate at the substrate under this restriction can successfully be provided by oxygen rf-plasmas, microwave-generated atomic oxygen, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) sources, and ozone-generation techniques. Sputter deposition suffers from negative ion bombardment of the substrate. This can be minimized by geometries where the substrate is held outside the plasma, and by applying high sputtering pressures with attendant short mean free paths. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) still shows some problems with volatile barium sources. Nevertheless, it represents one of the most promising techniques for large-scale applications. In the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, a high-energy pulse of ultraviolet or visible laser radiation vaporizes and ejects the surface material which impinges on the substrate subsequently. The process runs far off the thermal equilibrium, and therefore produces an extremely good stoichiometric material transfer. Furthermore, parameters can be chosen to allow for a wide dynamic range between molecular beam and heavy sputter conditions. there are practically no restrictions regarding the reactive gas atmosphere in the deposition chamber. Highest quality epitaxial films of the YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 superconductor made to date have been produced this way.

Temperature, pressure, atmospheric/surrounding environment, and heat-treatment processing are important parameters to get pure phase. Synthesis temperature range covers from a low (say 200\u00b0C) to a high temperature (2000\u00b0C). Pressure under hot/cold pressing is an important parameter in making different phases and stoichiometry. For preparation of nitrides, atmospheric/surrounding environment such as N2, NH3, and N2/H2 are required; and for preparation of carbides, methane, ethane, propane, and urea, C/CO/CO2/H2 are required; and boric acid or boron trioxide for preparation of borides has to be maintained. Heat-treatment effect such as quenching from high to low temperature and fast/slow heating is also important in production of unusual phases and tailoring of properties. Suitable precursors used during synthesis help in getting stoichiometric compounds. Their crystal structure and bonding can be characterized by many techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron scattering/diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman/infrared spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Stoichiometry can be determined by chemical analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In transition metal nitrides and carbides, N/C atoms usually occupy interstitial sites of host metal lattice, whereas B atoms do not occupy interstitial sites in transition metal borides. Microstructure can be investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic/magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM), etc. Samples with different particle sizes from micron to nanometer can be produced by varying heat-treatment procedures. Usually, borides, carbides, and nitrides have very good thermal conductivity but poor electrical conductivity. Some of them show superconductivity with T c from 1 to 39K (e.g., MgB2). Their hardness varies from soft to hard and can be comparable with diamond. The unusual high magnetic moment in Fe16N2 is observed as compared to pure iron. These materials have good thermal and chemical stability because of high melting points and covalent bonding character. They are used in many applications such as interconnector, electrical insulator, hard material, cutting tools (e.g., WC), bearing in motors, gas turbines, car engine parts, cantilevers in AFM, protective coating agents, diamagnetic sample holder (e.g., BN, SiN x ) in vibrating sample magnetometer and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic material, superconducting material, etc. They have aesthetic applications such as appearance of gold color after coating of material with TiN. Also, they are used as catalysts or support for catalyst in catalysis. They have extraordinary stability in H2 atmosphere. In view of the high neutron absorption cross-section, the boron carbides are used in nuclear reactors as control rods, shielding, and shutdown pellets.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2":

In addition, various first-principles software packages can produce input for FermiSurfer.

Observing the anisotropy, however, remains difficult. Thus, a graphical tool that can elucidate how quantities vary over complicated Fermi surfaces is highly desirable. Solution method: FermiSurfer uses the tetrahedron method to compute Fermi surfaces. The French-curve interpolation is used to display smooth Fermi surfaces.

The resultant reactions produced nanocrystalline YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 powders having well distributed Al2O3 nanoparticles (\u223c10nm). The TG/DTA analysis reveals that the Al nitrate added precursor gels decomposed by two-steps reaction at temperature of 180 and 220\u00b0C due to the decomposition of Al nitrate followed by Y, Ba and Cu nitrates. The XRD pattern showed the orthorhombic structure of Al2O3 added YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 powders having the particle size ranged in between 20 and 25nm. SEM analysis showed that Al2O3 nanoparticles were distributed along the grain boundaries of YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 matrix for the higher mol of Al nitrate. The higher concentration of Al2O3 reacts with the YBa2Cu3O7 matrix to form Al3+ rich spots and diffuse within the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 superconducting matrix which was confirmed by EDX analysis. The samples produced in this work were electrically superconducting at temperature above 85K as measured by using standard four-probe technique.

This effect has been associated to the microstructural features which produce a decrease on the number of grain boundaries, together with a reinforcement of weak grain links with metallic Ag.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "SC", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Process", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Element", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Material", "T13": "Material", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Process", "T19": "Property", "T20": "Element", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Element", "T26": "Material", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Material", "T31": "Property", "T32": "Element", "T35": "Value", "T36": "Value", "T37": "Process", "T3": "Main", "T4": "Material", "T8": "Property", "T39": "Element", "T21": "Doping", "T25": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 14], "T2": [19, 34], "T5": [98, 107], "T6": [141, 149], "T7": [155, 167], "T9": [215, 230], "T10": [255, 262], "T11": [263, 265], "T12": [266, 276], "T13": [292, 297], "T14": [316, 327], "T15": [349, 365], "T16": [402, 426], "T17": [448, 469], "T18": [488, 504], "T19": [505, 516], "T20": [556, 558], "T22": [587, 590], "T23": [609, 628], "T24": [645, 647], "T26": [706, 713], "T27": [733, 736], "T28": [803, 827], "T29": [870, 886], "T30": [926, 931], "T31": [943, 951], "T32": [952, 954], "T35": [79, 80], "T36": [85, 86], "T37": [122, 129], "T3": [49, 65], "T4": [200, 210], "T8": [696, 705], "T39": [73, 75], "T21": [562, 567], "T25": [648, 656]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T21", "E2": "T25"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T20"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T24"]]}}, {"text": "Summary A significant manifestation of interplay of superconductivity and charge density wave, spin density wave, or magnetism is a dome-like superconducting critical temperature (T c) in cuprate, iron-based, and heavy Fermion superconductors. Pesudogap, quantum critical point, and strange metals emerge in different doping ranges. Exploring dome-like T c in new superconductors is of interest to detect emergent effects. Here we report the superconductivity in a new layered Cu-based compound RE2Cu5As3O2 (RE = La, Pr, Nd), in which the T c exhibits dome-like variation with a maximum T c of 2.5, 1.2, and 1.0 K with substitution of Cu by large amount of Ni ions. Simultaneously, the structural parameters like As-As bond length and c/a ratio exhibit unusual variations as the Ni-doping level goes through the optimal value.

Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the electronic structure of four cuprate parent compounds belonging to two different families. We find that within each family, the double layer compound has a much smaller charge transfer gap size (\u2206 CT), indicating a clear anticorrelation between \u2206 CT and T c,max.

Low amounts (\u226410%) of Ni substitution on Nb sites cause structural distortions and induce drastic changes in the physical properties, such as the emergence of a bulk superconducting state with anomalous behaviors in the critical fields (lower and upper) and in the specific heat. Ni-doping at the 9 at.% level, for instance, is able to increase the critical temperature (T c ) in stoichiometric NbB2 (<1.3 K) to approximately 6.0 K. Bulk superconductivity is confirmed by magnetization, electronic transport, and specific heat measurements. Both H c1 and H c2 critical fields exhibit a linear dependence with reduced temperature (T/T c ), and the specific heat deviates remarkably from the conventional exponential temperature dependence of the single-band BCS theory.

Their crystal structures are relatively simple with a small number of constituent cation elements. In addition, the doping level can be varied by the chemical substitution over a wide range enough to obtain the full spectrum of doping-dependent electronic and magnetic properties. These attractive features have dedicated many researchers to thin-film growth of LSCO and LBCO. The critical temperature (T c) of LSCO and LBCO is sensitive to strain as manifested by a positive pressure coefficient of T c in bulk samples. In general, films are strained if they are grown on lattice-mismatched substrates (epitaxial strain). Early attempts (before 1997) at the growth of LSCO and LBCO films resulted in depressed T c below 30 K as they were grown on a commonly used SrTiO3 substrate (in-plane lattice parameter a sub = 3.905 \u00c5): the in-plane lattice parameters of LSCO and LBCO are \u22643.80 \u00c5, and hence tensile epitaxial strain is introduced. The situation was changed by the use of LaSrAlO4 substrates with a slightly shorter in-plane lattice constant (a sub = 3.756 \u00c5). On LaSrAlO4 substrates, the T c reaches 45 K in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4, 47 K in La1.85Ba0.15CuO4, and 56 K in ozone-oxidized La2CuO4+ \u03b4 films, substantially higher than the T c\u2019s of the bulk compounds. The T c increase in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 films on LaSrAlO4 and decrease on SrTiO3 are semi-quantitatively in accord with the phenomenological estimations based on the anisotropic strain coefficients of T c (dT c/d\u03b5i ). In this review article, we describe the growth and properties of films of cuprates having the K2NiF4 structure, mainly focusing on the increase/decrease of T c by epitaxial strain and quasi-stable phase formation by epitaxial stabilization. We further extract the structural and/or physical parameters controlling T c toward microscopic understanding of the variation of T c by epitaxial strain.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Main", "T2": "Main", "T3": "Main", "T4": "Main", "T5": "Material", "T6": "SC", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Material", "T12": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Process", "T18": "Element", "T19": "Element", "T20": "SC", "T21": "SC", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Process", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Process", "T31": "Material", "T32": "Material", "T35": "Process", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Material", "T39": "SC", "T40": "Process", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Material", "T44": "Material", "T45": "Material", "T46": "Material", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T51": "Element", "T52": "Material", "T53": "Material", "T54": "Material", "T55": "Element", "T56": "Material", "T57": "SC", "T58": "Element", "T59": "Element", "T60": "Process", "T61": "Element", "T62": "Material", "T63": "Material", "T64": "SC", "T65": "Element", "T66": "Material", "T67": "Element", "T68": "Element", "T69": "Property", "T71": "SC", "T72": "Process", "T73": "Material", "T74": "Element", "T75": "Element", "T76": "Material", "T77": "SC", "T80": "Material", "T82": "Material", "T83": "SC", "T84": "SC", "T91": "Property", "T93": "Value", "T94": "Value", "T96": "Value", "T98": "Value", "T99": "Value", "T100": "Value", "T101": "Value", "T9": "Property", "T70": "Property", "T33": "Material", "T34": "Material", "T49": "Material", "T50": "Material", "T10": "Doping", "T11": "Doping", "T78": "Doping", "T13": "Doping", "T79": "SC", "T85": "SC", "T81": "Process"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 16], "T2": [18, 22], "T3": [28, 44], "T4": [46, 50], "T5": [90, 99], "T6": [116, 140], "T7": [148, 166], "T8": [224, 230], "T12": [358, 366], "T14": [387, 397], "T15": [402, 421], "T16": [484, 493], "T17": [494, 500], "T18": [504, 508], "T19": [513, 517], "T20": [523, 543], "T21": [545, 548], "T22": [553, 557], "T23": [562, 566], "T24": [583, 589], "T25": [609, 626], "T26": [642, 645], "T27": [649, 661], "T28": [675, 680], "T29": [685, 693], "T30": [706, 711], "T31": [715, 722], "T32": [734, 744], "T35": [801, 807], "T36": [811, 815], "T37": [820, 824], "T38": [825, 830], "T39": [853, 856], "T40": [881, 886], "T41": [906, 912], "T42": [913, 922], "T43": [924, 932], "T44": [933, 950], "T45": [973, 981], "T46": [982, 1000], "T47": [1004, 1008], "T48": [1013, 1017], "T51": [1121, 1129], "T52": [1130, 1140], "T53": [1165, 1173], "T54": [1174, 1190], "T55": [1213, 1221], "T56": [1222, 1232], "T57": [1238, 1241], "T58": [1258, 1274], "T59": [1284, 1300], "T60": [1314, 1328], "T61": [1329, 1339], "T62": [1340, 1345], "T63": [1390, 1394], "T64": [1410, 1413], "T65": [1426, 1442], "T66": [1443, 1448], "T67": [1452, 1460], "T68": [1477, 1483], "T69": [1569, 1600], "T71": [1604, 1607], "T72": [1661, 1667], "T73": [1686, 1691], "T74": [1695, 1703], "T75": [1715, 1721], "T76": [1722, 1731], "T77": [1777, 1780], "T80": [1818, 1833], "T82": [1885, 1895], "T83": [1935, 1938], "T84": [1992, 1995], "T91": [104, 108], "T93": [863, 867], "T94": [959, 966], "T96": [1023, 1029], "T98": [1200, 1207], "T99": [1250, 1254], "T100": [1276, 1280], "T101": [1306, 1310], "T9": [1527, 1555], "T70": [1805, 1817], "T33": [746, 762], "T34": [1049, 1065], "T49": [1784, 1800], "T50": [1999, 2015], "T10": [109, 114], "T11": [258, 264], "T78": [370, 376], "T13": [301, 313], "T79": [1377, 1382], "T85": [1609, 1613], "T81": [1837, 1860]}, "r_type_dict": {"R4": "Equivalent", "R5": "Equivalent", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Target", "R8": "Target", "R9": "Equivalent", "R10": "Equivalent", "R11": "Target", "R12": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R4": ["T57", "T99"], "R5": ["T57", "T100"], "R6": ["T99", "T58"], "R7": ["T100", "T59"], "R8": ["T101", "T61"], "R9": ["T39", "T93"], "R10": ["T57", "T101"], "R11": ["T93", "T37"], "R12": ["T93", "T36"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E3": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T10", "E2": "T11", "E4": "T78", "E3": "T13"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T91"]], "E2": [], "E4": [], "E3": []}}, {"text": "New magneto-optical vitreous materials were obtained by melting-quenching technique comprising wet route raw materials preparation.

The films were grown in situ on polished MgO (100) substrates by unbalanced DC magnetron sputtering at a growth rate of 3 nm/min. We use a combination of high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction, and transport-property measurements. The results from ultrathin films, 3 to 50 c\u22a5 unit cells (1 c\u22a5 unit cell equals 1.17 nm) indicate that epitaxial growth proceeds by the classical screw dislocation mediated three-dimensional island growth mode, i.e. each island grows both vertically and laterally by the incorporation of adatoms at a spirally expanding step emanating from one or more screw dislocations. The initial adatom clustering leads to a high density of nuclei (\u22482\u00d71011 cm \u22122). The density of screw dislocations, \u03f1screw, determined from STM images of the film surface, is found to depend on both the thickness of films and the growth temperature. At moderate growth temperatures (720\u2013760\u00b0C) the early stage of coalescence of nuclei and island growth is characterised by a high density of screw dislocations, (3\u20139)\u00d7109 cm \u22122, decreasing to (2\u20133)\u00d7109 cm \u22122 for 200 c\u22a5 unit-cells films.

A correlation is found between high values of \u03f1screw and high values of the critical current density.

Stripes decoupling at low temperature, via strong magnetic fields, induces again a 1D stripe behavior, which, in the presence of impurity centers, leads to blocking of the 1D intra-stripe transport and consequently to the formation of the insulating state in underdoped La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 at T\u21920.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Property", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Main", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Element", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Property", "T11": "SC", "T12": "Element", "T13": "Material", "T14": "SC", "T15": "SC", "T16": "SC", "T17": "Process", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T23": "Element", "T28": "Value", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Property", "T32": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Characterization", "T1": "Doping", "T22": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [61, 73], "T3": [86, 97], "T4": [102, 113], "T5": [122, 134], "T6": [135, 144], "T7": [145, 153], "T8": [241, 252], "T9": [327, 347], "T10": [434, 458], "T11": [493, 495], "T12": [529, 533], "T13": [534, 540], "T14": [608, 610], "T15": [619, 634], "T16": [653, 655], "T17": [679, 694], "T18": [707, 722], "T19": [786, 794], "T20": [845, 854], "T21": [896, 912], "T23": [927, 939], "T28": [945, 946], "T29": [740, 742], "T30": [570, 572], "T31": [573, 602], "T32": [829, 831], "T34": [385, 393], "T35": [307, 309], "T36": [253, 255], "T37": [509, 511], "T38": [414, 426], "T1": [47, 53], "T22": [916, 926]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E2", "T23"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T1", "E2": "T22"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": []}}, {"text": "The YBa2(Cu0.99 57Fe0.01)3O7\u2212y system with a precisely determined oxygen content in the range 0.03\u2264y\u22640.80 has bee n obtained for the first time.

With the expansion of network, the level of short-circuit currents is also increasingly rising. One of the ways that can be considered to reduce short circuit current is SFCLs. This kind of equipment in compared with other FCL has some disadvantages, such as large size (especially in inductive type), high cost, and the need for a powerful cooling system along with great benefits such as very fast performance in less than a half cycle, and they don't need any triggering circuit. Superconductors lose their superconducting behavior above a critical temperature. So, they must always work under their critical temperature. To reduce the recovery time, it is necessary to increase the power of the cooling system or a method is used to accelerate the transfer of the heat which produced by fault current in HTS. In this paper, a heat sink is designed to improve the thermal behavior of HTS material in SFCL instead of using bulk cooling systems in order to decrease the recovery time. The results show that, in addition to reducing the recovery time, the temperature distribution across the throughout HTS surface is uniform and, as a result, the disadvantages of the hotspot phenomenon will also be eliminated. Different modes of designing punched fins to the HTS cylinder located in a magnetic shield open-core superconductor limiter have been evaluated. The results suggest that with the full coverage of the HTS cylinder by an aluminum tube and placing the fins on its outer surface, the thermal performance of the magnetic shield core SFCL will be best achieved. Also, the effect of adding additional elements to the SFCL chamber is considered in terms of pressure and stress variations and the results are presented.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Process", "T3": "SC", "T4": "SC", "T5": "SC", "T6": "SC", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Process", "T9": "Material", "T10": "SC", "T11": "SC", "T12": "Material", "T13": "Process", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Process", "T17": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T20": "SC", "T21": "Material", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T24": "SC", "T25": "SC", "T26": "Element", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Process", "T31": "Process", "T32": "Property", "T18": "Process", "T33": "Process", "T34": "Process", "T16": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T30": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [34, 42], "T2": [453, 460], "T3": [595, 610], "T4": [622, 637], "T5": [655, 675], "T6": [715, 735], "T7": [751, 759], "T8": [811, 818], "T9": [903, 908], "T10": [920, 923], "T11": [999, 1002], "T12": [1003, 1011], "T13": [1015, 1019], "T14": [1037, 1041], "T15": [1042, 1049], "T17": [1083, 1091], "T19": [1149, 1157], "T20": [1215, 1218], "T21": [1219, 1226], "T22": [1374, 1377], "T23": [1400, 1408], "T24": [1426, 1440], "T25": [1525, 1528], "T26": [1544, 1552], "T27": [1592, 1599], "T28": [1632, 1640], "T29": [1653, 1657], "T31": [1774, 1782], "T32": [1787, 1793], "T18": [1735, 1739], "T33": [335, 338], "T34": [282, 287], "T16": [1168, 1192], "T35": [263, 278], "T30": [1701, 1707]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T30"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": []}}, {"text": "In order to reveal the role of \u201ccarrier doping\u201d in the iron-based superconductors, we investigated the transport properties of the oxygen-deficient iron-arsenides LnFeAsO1\u2212y (Ln=La, Ce, Pr and Nd) over a wide doping range.

In this system, the magnetic coupling of RuO2 and CuO2 plays an important role in magnetic and superconducting states. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that all samples are single phase and the lattice parameters decrease continuously by increasing Ca content. The onset superconducting transition temperature is found to decrease with Ca substitution. As Ca content increases, rotation of the RuO6 octahedron increases and Ru\u2013O(1)\u2013Ru angle decreases. These variations strengthen the magnetic moments in the RuO2 planes.

It was also observed that the crystal lattice parameters and the mean diameter of the non-superconducting Y2BaCuO5 particles systematically change with Li concentration.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Main", "T2": "Material", "T3": "Material", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Element", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Process", "T9": "Process", "T11": "Property", "T13": "Element", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Element", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Element", "T18": "Material", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T23": "Process", "T24": "Element", "T25": "Element", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Process", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Material", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Material", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Material", "T37": "Process", "T38": "Element", "T39": "Property", "T40": "Property", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Material", "T44": "SC", "T45": "Element", "T46": "Material", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Material", "T49": "Material", "T51": "Property", "T52": "Element", "T53": "Material", "T54": "Element", "T55": "Property", "T8": "Process", "T10": "Characterization", "T12": "Doping", "T19": "Doping", "T50": "Doping", "T56": "Characterization"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 23], "T2": [24, 36], "T3": [37, 41], "T4": [42, 57], "T5": [73, 75], "T6": [76, 90], "T7": [96, 101], "T9": [123, 134], "T11": [183, 196], "T13": [242, 244], "T14": [245, 250], "T15": [258, 260], "T16": [261, 266], "T17": [285, 296], "T18": [297, 312], "T20": [378, 385], "T21": [414, 421], "T22": [466, 490], "T23": [503, 512], "T24": [532, 538], "T25": [543, 548], "T26": [565, 603], "T27": [654, 656], "T28": [663, 674], "T29": [688, 696], "T30": [700, 705], "T31": [762, 764], "T32": [765, 770], "T33": [783, 786], "T34": [787, 793], "T35": [802, 806], "T36": [807, 813], "T37": [831, 840], "T38": [844, 850], "T39": [873, 899], "T40": [916, 923], "T41": [938, 961], "T42": [962, 974], "T43": [975, 979], "T44": [980, 995], "T45": [1037, 1039], "T46": [1040, 1045], "T47": [1053, 1064], "T48": [1065, 1080], "T49": [1112, 1138], "T51": [1168, 1187], "T52": [1188, 1196], "T53": [1197, 1206], "T54": [1234, 1236], "T55": [1237, 1250], "T8": [517, 528], "T10": [144, 163], "T12": [222, 234], "T19": [319, 331], "T50": [657, 662], "T56": [197, 209]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target", "R2": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E1", "T17"], "R2": ["E3", "T28"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T12", "E2": "T19", "E3": "T50"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Site", "T13"], ["Dopant", "T15"]], "E2": [], "E3": [["Dopant", "T27"]]}}, {"text": "A comprehensive study of upper critical and irreversibility magnetic fields in Ba(Fe0.95Ni0.05)2As2 (large grain and small grain samples), Ba(Fe0.94Ni0.06)2As2, Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2, and Ba(Fe0.92Co0.09)2As2 polycrystalline bulk pnictide superconductors was made in pulsed fields of up to 65T.

AC susceptibility (\u03c7 = \u03c7 + i\u03c7\u2033) measurements showed the highest superconducting transition temperature T c\u03c7\u2032 = 71 K for x = 0.4. The peak temperature, T p of the imaginary part of the susceptibility, \u03c7\u2033 was also the highest for x = 0.4 sample (T p = 69 K). The inter-grain critical current density at the peak temperature, J c(T p) for all samples was between 17 and 19 A cm\u22122.

This conclusion is based on various types of analyses of electrochemically lithium-reacted samples which include, for the first time to be reported, their electronic transport and magnetic susceptibility behavior at superconducting temperatures, determination of their oxygen content, peak assignment of the additional phase in their powder X-ray diffraction pattern, and lithium analysis of samples reacted and after cell charging.

The magnetic phase diagram H\u2212T constructed for DyBa1.5Sr0.5Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 and DyBaSrCu3O7\u2212\u03b4 compounds is topologically identical wit h the phase diagram of DyBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 where one H c (T) line of the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in the magnetic field is seen. It was shown that the replacement of Ba2+ by Sr2+ leads to an enhancement of the low-dimensional properties. This is manifested by the appearance of a significant difference between the temperature of maximum \u03c7 (T), characterizing 2D magnetic correlations, and the Neel temperature, T N, corresponding to a 3D ordering. In the DyBa2\u2212x Sr x Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 system ther e is a structural phase transition with a heat absorption at the temperature of about 2.4 K.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "SC", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "SC", "T11": "SC", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Property", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Material", "T26": "Element", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Main", "T30": "Value", "T31": "Value", "T32": "Value", "T34": "Element", "T39": "Element", "T43": "Property", "T44": "Property", "T45": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T51": "Property", "T52": "Property", "T53": "Element", "T54": "Element", "T56": "Value", "T57": "Element", "T62": "Element", "T6": "Property", "T1": "Doping", "T18": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [55, 70], "T3": [75, 94], "T4": [98, 105], "T5": [140, 155], "T7": [220, 233], "T8": [238, 261], "T9": [339, 350], "T10": [418, 456], "T11": [457, 460], "T12": [547, 562], "T13": [624, 632], "T14": [633, 646], "T15": [752, 765], "T16": [812, 829], "T17": [861, 875], "T20": [1116, 1140], "T21": [1150, 1166], "T23": [1195, 1203], "T24": [1252, 1279], "T26": [33, 37], "T27": [43, 47], "T28": [106, 118], "T30": [315, 318], "T31": [303, 304], "T32": [306, 309], "T34": [265, 285], "T39": [769, 781], "T43": [388, 402], "T44": [506, 520], "T45": [667, 686], "T48": [691, 704], "T51": [601, 608], "T52": [830, 842], "T53": [922, 926], "T54": [930, 934], "T56": [1331, 1336], "T57": [1212, 1232], "T62": [591, 600], "T6": [1287, 1302], "T1": [17, 29], "T18": [907, 918]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E1", "T28"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T1", "E2": "T18"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Site", "T26"], ["Dopant", "T27"]], "E2": [["Site", "T53"], ["Dopant", "T54"]]}}, {"text": "High temperature superconducting current leads are composed of a normal metal part, conducting the current from room temperature to an intermediate temperature (often 77 K), and a high T c part, conducting the current down to liquid helium temperature. The cryogenic load and the corresponding power consumption of both parts are compared to the electrical power consumption of an equivalent all metal current lead. The temperature profiles and the 4.2 K heat load of the superconducting part are evaluated by a computer calculation. The calculation uses material parameters from sintered Y-123 and melt-cast processed Bi-2212 tubes, materials which already exist in usable dimensions for current leads. The 1 \u03bcV cm \u22121 criterion turns out to be much too conservative and some dissipation due to flux flow in the upper part of the lead does not affect the overall performance of the current lead if the thermal runaway current I TR is not exceeded. The maximum stable current is evaluated as a function of conductor length for operation in a self-field and applied fields up to 0.2 T. Long leads result in very low 4.2 K heat loads but shorter leads result in higher stable transport currents. The use of very short high T c conductor parts (50 mm) and the possibility of fabricating a short metallic lead for 77 K operation allows us to design very short (< 0.3 m) and high performance current leads for 4.2 K applications. This current lead can be designed to pass right through the insulating vacuum of a cryostat, presenting new opportunities for a more compact cryostat system.

For this purpose, c-axis oriented YBCO films with a thickness between 130 and 280 nm were deposited on single crystal MgO (100) substrates and patterned in a meander structure. The aim of the meander structure was to increase the responsivity at temperatures below the transition temperature. These films were irradiated with 10 \u03bcm 35 ps pulses generated by an optical free induction decay (OFID) 10 \u03bcm CO2 laser system developed in our laboratory. We have observed that the form of the transients depends on the temperature. At temperatures below the transition temperature, the photoresponse consists of a 700 ps FWHM peak followed by a slow negative transient. This is the first time that such short transients were observed with 10 \u03bcm irradiation. At temperatures above the transition temperature, the transients exhibit a decay in the nanosecond range. We have developed a bolometric model which reproduces well the measured dependence of the peak amplitude of the slow transients on the temperature. We have also investigated the dependence of the fast transients on the bias current and temperature. The observed linear dependence of the peak amplitude of the fast transients on the bias current and the negative transient following the main peak exclude flux-flow and nonequilibrium effects as photoresponse mechanisms, whilst these characteristics agree well with a kinetic-inductance model. The measured dependence of the peak amplitude on the temperature permits one to distinguish between several models for the superfluid fraction \u0192 sc. Thus, we have established that the models with superfluid fractions \u0192 sc= 1 \u2212 (T/T c)2 and \u0192 sc given by the BCS theory are compatible with our results, whereas the model with \u0192 sc = 1 \u2212 (T/T c)4 corresponding to the Gorter-Casimir two-fluid model does not match our results.

Also, physical and the bulk superconducting properties of the welded samples have not been investigated. In this study, two 20 wt% Y211 and two 30 wt% Y211 added YBCO main samples were fabricated by cold top seeding-melt-growth (TSMG) method by using an Nd123 seed. Two main samples having the same Y211 addition and welding sample positioned between the main samples stacked and welded thermally with a pressure source simultaneously. It can be seen from the levitation force measurement, making before the welding process, that the 30 wt% Y211 added samples have the larger the maximum repulsive forces values than the 20 wt% Y211 added and Ag2O added welding samples but at the same order. After the welding process the welded samples cut into the specimens, to investigate micro structure and electromagnetic properties, positioned above, on and below of the welding region of the each welded Y123 samples. From the SEM analysis a continuous structural phase was obtained between the solder material and the main samples with a good integration without any boundary gap or defects. The welding process had no negative noticeable effect on T c of the samples under zero magnetic field, while superconducting transition width (\u2206T c) of the specimen cutting from the 30 wt% Y211 added sample (Y30-ab) is smaller the specimen cutting from the 20 wt% Y211 added sample (Y20-ab) under applied magnetic field points out that Y30-ab is more resistant to the applied field than the Y20-ab because of the 211 addition.

A tuning of the oxygen content in the as-grown non-superconducting samples has been achieved by changing the oxygen partial pressure during the growth in the Argon sputtering atmosphere. All samples show the superconducting transition after a suitable two-step thermal treatment in an oxygen-reducing environment. Structural and electrical transport properties on the as-grown as well as on the superconducting samples have been investigated. We find that the structural properties are consistent with a deficiency of the oxygen content with respect to optimally annealed samples, and that the transition to the superconducting phase is always accompanied by an increase of the c-axis lattice parameter. Measurements of the Hall coefficient R H as a function of temperature and in the normal state of our epitaxial films are presented and discussed. R H results negative for all the films regardless of the oxygen content and it decreases with the temperature. In particular, the Hall coefficient is only about 10% lower than the value measured in the as-grown oxygen-deficient phase, in contrast to the results reported in literature. The removal of the excess oxygen in as-grown samples seems not to be the only requirement for triggering the superconducting transition in electron-doped compounds.

Ti-doped samples have shown orthorhombic crystal structure and the cell parameters increase with the increase of Ti-contents. The T c(R =0) and onset of diamagnetism increases with increase Ti-doping in the final compound. The magnitude of superconductivity, however, increases for Ti-doping of y =0.25,0.75. The numbers of carriers in the conducting planes have been optimized by carrying out post-annealing of the samples in oxygen atmosphere. After the post-annealing the T c(R =0) is improved in un-doped samples whereas it is suppressed in all Ti-doped samples. After post annealing in oxygen atmosphere, the magnitude of superconductivity (measured in emu/gm.Os) remains unchanged in un-doped samples whereas it is suppressed in all Ti-doped samples. In FTIR absorption measurements, the CuO2/TiO2 planar oxygen modes are slightly hardened in Ti-doped samples. The most likely reason for the hardening of the planar oxygen modes is decrease in the mass of Ti (47.90amu) in comparison with Cu (63.54amu) atoms; the atoms with lighter-mass vibrate at higher frequency. It is most likely that the existence of atoms of different masses in CuO2/TiO2 planes may suppress the density of phonon population due to setting-in of an-harmonic oscillations. The phonons of harmonic oscillation with wave vector q interact with q\u2032 of an-harmonic oscillation and produce a new phonon with wave vector Q. The phonons with wave vector Q do not contribute in the Cooper-pair formation. It is most likely that a decrease in the population of desired phonons required for higher T c occurs that in turn suppress the density of the Cooper-pair which in turn promote a decrease in the magnitude of superconductivity.

All the wire and tape samples have shown the ability to transport superconducting current. Critical current density Jc was enhanced upon silver addition, and at 4.2K, a largest Jc of \u223c1200A/cm2 (Ic =9A) was achieved for 20% silver added tapes, which is the highest in iron-based wires and tapes so far. The Jc is almost field independent between 1T and 10T, exhibiting a strong vortex pinning. Such a high transport critical current density is attributed to the weak reaction between the silver sheath and the superconducting core, as well as an improved connectivity between grains. We also identify a weak-link behavior from the apparent drop of Jc at low fields and a hysteretic phenomenon.

[1] have visualized the gap formation in nanoscale regions (NRs) above the critical temperature T c in the high-T c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 . It has been found that, as the temperature lowers, the NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities. The fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of the NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of these overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and percolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping x c1, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive electric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a single hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At the second critical doping x c2, when the superconductivity disappears, our analysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of x c2 can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions in NRs, whose concentration appearing above x c1 increases smoothly with the doping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x c2. The last one results in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region, which explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3]. Since Gomes et al. [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can conclude that along this boundary, as well as in x c2, all bosons disappear. As justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2D fermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons.

We observed the tendency of Au nanoparticles to occupy the inter-granular spaces (grain-boundaries) as the tetragonal structure of CuTl-1223 superconducting matrix remained unaltered after the addition of Au nanoparticles. The improvement in the superconducting properties after the addition of Au nanoparticles can be attributed to an increase in the inter-grains connectivity by healing up the inter-grains voids and pores by these nanoparticles.

The orthorhombicity of OI decreases with increasing \u03b4, that of OM increases with \u03b4. A spinodal phase segregation into an oxygen-rich superconductive phase and an oxygen-poor antiferromagnetic phase occurs in the temperature interval 220K < T \u2264 T sp; below 220 K, the mobility of the interstitial oxygen becomes too low for a further static phase segregation. The phase segregation causes an increase in resistivity and a decrease in the Seebeck coefficient with decreasing temperature in the interval 220 < T < T sp. A similar transport behavior occurs in the range T c < T < T \u03f1 \u2264 120 K in samples 0.02 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.04; from comparisons with the La2\u2212x Sr x CuO4 system, we suggest that at lower temperatures this behavior is the signature for a further dynamic hole segregation, induced by atomic displacements, into domains more rich in mobile holes within the superconductive phase.

The experimental findings of the dc electrical resistivity and XRD investigations present that the Au impurities are effectively entered into the crystalline structure of the Bi-2212 system. In fact, the EDX examinations confirm that the Au impurities may mostly be substituted for the Sr-sites in the Bi-2212 crystal matrix due to the increase of electronegativity. Besides, the J c measurements present that highly dispersed Au impurities with higher electronegativity bind tightly to form the effective nucleation centers through the intra-grain and inter-grain boundaries for the flux pinning of the vortices in the Bi-2212 crystal structure. Furthermore, it is observed that the vital characteristics, being responsible for newly/novel and feasible market areas for the universe economy, improve significantly with the increment in the diffusion annealing temperature up to the value of 800 \u00b0C as a consequence of the retrogression in the disorders, dislocations, defects, lattice strains, misorientations and local structural distortions in the Cu-O2 consecutively stacked layers, leading to the development of the metastability (enhancement of the hole trap energy) belonging to the superconducting materials studied. However, after the critical temperature point, the properties recrudesce dramatically due to the penetration of excess Au foreign impurities in the Bi-2212 crystal structure. In more details, the XRD measurement findings display that the diffusion annealing temperature promotes significantly the high phase as a consequence of the increment in both the average crystallite size and c-axis length or decrement in the constant parameter a. In this respect, the solid compound produced at the annealing temperature of 800 \u00b0C obtains the maximum (minimum) c-axis length of 35.43 \u00c5 (5.32 \u00c5) and average grain size of 68.7 nm. Similarly, the same sample exhibits the smoothest and densest surface morphology with the best interaction between the superconducting grains and largest crystalline distribution. Finally, the highest T c o n s e t and T c o f f s e t values are noted to be about 89.78 K and 89.01 K, respectively. This is attributed to the fact that the Au nanoparticles penetrated transit from inherently overdoped nature of the Bi-2212 compound to optimally doped state. To sum up, the annealing temperature of 800 \u00b0C favors the Bi-2212 superconducting ceramics for usage in the large scale applications.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Process", "T3": "Property", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Material", "T7": "Main", "T8": "Material", "T10": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Characterization", "T17": "Characterization", "T18": "Characterization", "T19": "Characterization", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Characterization", "T22": "Characterization", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Characterization", "T26": "Element", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Element", "T30": "Characterization", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Material", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Material", "T37": "Material", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Material", "T41": "Material", "T44": "Property", "T45": "Property", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Material", "T48": "Property", "T49": "Process", "T50": "Material", "T51": "Material", "T52": "Material", "T53": "Material", "T54": "Property", "T55": "Material", "T56": "Material", "T57": "Element", "T58": "Material", "T59": "Property", "T60": "SC", "T61": "Material", "T62": "Property", "T63": "Element", "T64": "Material", "T65": "Element", "T66": "Material", "T67": "Characterization", "T68": "Property", "T69": "Process", "T70": "Material", "T71": "Material", "T72": "Process", "T73": "Material", "T74": "Material", "T75": "Material", "T76": "Material", "T77": "SC", "T78": "Material", "T79": "Material", "T81": "SC", "T82": "Element", "T83": "Material", "T85": "Element", "T87": "Process", "T88": "Element", "T89": "SC", "T90": "Material", "T11": "Property", "T12": "Property", "T93": "Material", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Value", "T95": "Value", "T96": "Value", "T97": "SC", "T80": "Value", "T98": "Value", "T99": "Value", "T100": "Value", "T6": "Element", "T23": "Property", "T1": "Material", "T92": "Material", "T94": "Value", "T9": "Characterization", "T33": "Doping", "T84": "Doping", "T86": "Doping", "T101": "Doping", "T91": "Value", "T102": "Value", "T103": "Property", "T34": "Element", "T38": "Property", "T104": "Characterization"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [73, 94], "T3": [130, 140], "T4": [142, 157], "T5": [162, 177], "T7": [215, 222], "T8": [223, 238], "T10": [308, 320], "T13": [344, 353], "T14": [354, 378], "T15": [380, 383], "T16": [387, 411], "T17": [413, 416], "T18": [419, 447], "T19": [449, 452], "T20": [458, 466], "T21": [478, 483], "T22": [485, 488], "T24": [537, 562], "T25": [567, 570], "T26": [603, 605], "T27": [606, 616], "T28": [650, 671], "T29": [679, 686], "T30": [708, 711], "T31": [742, 744], "T32": [745, 755], "T35": [806, 813], "T36": [814, 821], "T37": [822, 828], "T39": [931, 933], "T40": [934, 944], "T41": [1010, 1020], "T44": [1088, 1100], "T45": [1108, 1116], "T46": [1124, 1131], "T47": [1132, 1149], "T48": [1345, 1354], "T49": [1355, 1376], "T50": [1448, 1457], "T51": [1459, 1471], "T52": [1473, 1480], "T53": [1482, 1489], "T54": [1490, 1497], "T55": [1499, 1514], "T56": [1525, 1547], "T57": [1555, 1560], "T58": [1583, 1589], "T59": [1659, 1668], "T60": [1694, 1709], "T61": [1710, 1719], "T62": [1748, 1768], "T63": [1848, 1850], "T64": [1859, 1869], "T65": [1877, 1884], "T66": [1885, 1902], "T67": [1925, 1940], "T68": [1967, 1976], "T69": [1977, 1998], "T70": [2112, 2125], "T71": [2189, 2194], "T72": [2220, 2241], "T73": [2282, 2295], "T74": [2328, 2333], "T75": [2413, 2420], "T76": [2421, 2431], "T77": [2470, 2485], "T78": [2486, 2492], "T79": [2505, 2516], "T81": [2570, 2585], "T82": [2690, 2692], "T83": [2693, 2706], "T85": [2766, 2773], "T87": [2824, 2845], "T88": [2867, 2874], "T89": [2875, 2890], "T90": [2891, 2899], "T11": [322, 336], "T12": [852, 869], "T93": [1041, 1052], "T42": [1057, 1079], "T43": [1396, 1402], "T95": [2615, 2622], "T96": [2627, 2634], "T97": [2552, 2565], "T80": [2849, 2855], "T98": [2299, 2306], "T99": [2308, 2314], "T100": [2342, 2349], "T6": [196, 198], "T23": [957, 974], "T1": [2155, 2166], "T92": [2091, 2107], "T94": [2245, 2251], "T9": [490, 502], "T33": [209, 214], "T84": [770, 781], "T86": [2742, 2751], "T101": [2796, 2801], "T91": [109, 115], "T102": [116, 122], "T103": [338, 341], "T34": [790, 792], "T38": [884, 887], "T104": [888, 900]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Equivalent", "R2": "Equivalent", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Target", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["T97", "T95"], "R2": ["T81", "T96"], "R3": ["E1", "T7"], "R4": ["E3", "T85"], "R5": ["E4", "T85"], "R6": ["E2", "T35"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T33", "E2": "T84", "E3": "T86", "E4": "T101"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T6"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T31"], ["Site", "T34"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T82"]], "E4": [["Dopant", "T82"]]}}, {"text": "LaFe1-xZnxAsO0.85F0.15 composites were synthesized by solid state reaction in order to improve the mechanical properties while trying to keep the superconductivity.

The excessive hole doping of the superconducting CuO2-planes is suggested to be responsible for the decrease of T c at high oxygen concentrations.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Property", "T3": "SC", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Process", "T11": "SC", "T12": "Property", "T13": "SC", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Material", "T18": "Property", "T20": "SC", "T21": "Material", "T22": "SC", "T24": "Value", "T25": "Main", "T27": "Value", "T29": "Value", "T30": "Element", "T10": "Property", "T32": "Element", "T17": "Property", "T23": "Property", "T33": "Process", "T1": "Process", "T6": "SC", "T9": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [65, 77], "T3": [82, 97], "T4": [136, 144], "T5": [158, 173], "T7": [286, 300], "T8": [369, 378], "T11": [527, 530], "T12": [581, 595], "T13": [656, 659], "T14": [727, 742], "T15": [794, 806], "T16": [819, 825], "T18": [872, 876], "T20": [891, 906], "T21": [912, 918], "T22": [970, 973], "T24": [498, 503], "T25": [124, 135], "T27": [182, 186], "T29": [307, 311], "T30": [814, 818], "T10": [454, 469], "T32": [907, 911], "T17": [841, 856], "T23": [982, 1003], "T33": [37, 57], "T1": [382, 394], "T6": [207, 245], "T9": [877, 883]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T9"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T18"], ["Site", "T32"]]}}, {"text": "We have investigated the electronic structure and magnetic properties of CeRu2Al2B using density functional theory within the local spin density approximation (LSDA)+ U schemes.

Although the U metal is Pauli paramagnet, the reduced 5f\u20135f overlap in compounds allows for moment formation and ordering, typically if the U\u2013U spacing exceeds the Hill limit, i.e. about 340pm. The stable form of UH3, known as \u03b2-UH3, has rather high T C\u2248170K. Such high value is rather unusual, considering d U\u2013U=331pm. Properties of metastable \u03b1-UH3 with d U\u2013U=360pm could be never well established. Using the fact that \u03b1-UH3 is in fact bcc U with interstitials filled by H, we attempted to synthesize \u03b1-UH3 starting from the \u03b3-U alloys, with the bcc structure retained to room temperature by doping combined with ultrafast cooling. While up to 15% Zr a contamination by \u03b2-UH3 was obtained, 20% Zr yielded single phase \u03b1-UH3. The T C value remains high and very similar to \u03b2-UH3. One can see an increase up to 187K for 15% Zr, followed by a weak decrease. Magnetic moments remain close to 1\u03bcB/U atom. An insight is provided by ab-initio calculations, revealing a charge transfer towards H-1s states, depopulating the U-6d and 7s states, leaving almost pure 5f character around the Fermi level. The 5f magnetism exhibits a high coercivity (\u03bc0 H c up to 5.5T) and large spontaneous volume magnetostriction of 3.2\u204e10\u22123. Even higher increase of T C, reaching up to 203K, can be achieved in analogous Mo stabilized hydrides, which yield an amorphous structure. The compounds represent, together with known hydrides of U6Fe and U6Co, a new group of robust 5f ferromagnets with small d U\u2013U but high T C.

XRD analysis indicates a decrease in lattice parameters of coronene added samples and confirms substitution of carbon in boron sites. An increase in lattice strain and a decrease in grain size are observed due to the carbon substitution effect. Vertical and lateral levitation force measurements under zero-field-cooled and field-cooled regimes were carried out at different temperatures of 20, 25 and 30 K. It was found that the coronene addition significantly increases the high-field critical current density of MgB2. The J c values were obtained as 4.6 \u00d7 103 Acm\u22122 and 1.3 \u00d7 104 Acm\u22122 for pure and 4 wt % coronene added samples at 20 K and 4 T. In addition, the levitation force measurements show that 4 wt % coronene adding is very effective in increasing both the vertical and lateral levitation force performances at 20 K. The maximum levitation force for 4 wt % coronene added sample corresponds to 7.58 N/g whereas the reference sample shows 6.73 N/g at 20 K in ZFC regime.

First, we took into account the experimental evidence that at temperatures below 50 K, the crystal structure of PdH and of PdD is zincblende. Second, we take into account not only the influence of the electron-phonon interaction but also the electron-electron interaction contribution to the isotope coefficient due to the replacement of deuterium in the place of hydrogen. We used the Migdal-Eliashberg theory to perform our ab initio calculations.

The abrupt quenching of the magnetism from the Co to Ni-based compounds is very similar to those from Fe to Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but vanishes in the Co-based ones.

This improvement was mainly attributed to the C substitution and the fine grain size due to PAA doping, suggesting that PAA is an effective dopant in improving Jc (B) performance of MgB2.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Element", "T2": "Element", "T4": "Main", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Element", "T12": "Element", "T14": "Element", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T20": "Element", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Element", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T30": "Material", "T31": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Material", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Material", "T38": "Value", "T39": "Value", "T41": "Value", "T42": "Value", "T43": "Process", "T44": "Process", "T3": "Doping", "T11": "Doping", "T13": "Doping", "T19": "Doping", "T29": "Doping", "T32": "Doping", "T40": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [14, 30], "T2": [32, 35], "T4": [43, 47], "T5": [48, 53], "T6": [139, 154], "T7": [156, 163], "T8": [172, 186], "T9": [192, 200], "T10": [229, 232], "T12": [251, 254], "T14": [276, 279], "T15": [291, 305], "T16": [336, 352], "T17": [357, 377], "T18": [379, 381], "T20": [428, 429], "T21": [439, 440], "T22": [444, 448], "T23": [467, 491], "T24": [493, 495], "T25": [506, 521], "T26": [551, 554], "T27": [590, 593], "T28": [729, 730], "T30": [757, 762], "T31": [775, 778], "T33": [803, 806], "T34": [823, 829], "T35": [843, 845], "T36": [865, 869], "T37": [329, 335], "T38": [566, 576], "T39": [585, 589], "T41": [670, 672], "T42": [677, 681], "T43": [57, 67], "T44": [72, 96], "T3": [37, 42], "T11": [233, 239], "T13": [255, 261], "T19": [412, 424], "T29": [594, 599], "T32": [731, 743], "T40": [779, 785]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Target", "R4": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["E1", "T4"], "R4": ["E4", "T22"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T3", "E2": "T11", "E3": "T13", "E4": "T19", "E5": "T29", "E6": "T32", "E7": "T40"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T1"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T10"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T12"]], "E4": [["Site", "T20"], ["Dopant", "T21"]], "E5": [["Dopant", "T27"]], "E6": [["Dopant", "T28"]], "E7": [["Dopant", "T31"]]}}, {"text": "The temperature dependence of the specific heat C(T) has been measured for YBa2(Cu1\u2212xMx)3O7 (YBCO) with M = Zn and Ni and 1.2<T<20 K.

Both methods revealed no significant differences in the behavior of the g(E F) between the solid solution and stoichiometric series. However, the g(E F) calculated by the first method decreases fast with deviation from the initial composition, whereas the results of the second method remain nearly constant over a wide range of composition factors. The value of the g(E F) obtained for the initial SmBa2Cu3O6.85 sample from the jump of the specific heat at T c based on BCS theory also agrees well with the values calculated from transport measurements.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "Material", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Property", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Property", "T10": "SC", "T11": "Property", "T12": "SC", "T13": "SC", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Property", "T17": "SC", "T18": "Property", "T20": "Material", "T21": "SC", "T24": "Main", "T27": "Value", "T28": "Value", "T29": "Element", "T31": "Value", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Element", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Element", "T39": "Property", "T40": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T23": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T25": "Characterization"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [86, 98], "T2": [102, 112], "T3": [264, 278], "T4": [308, 330], "T5": [334, 348], "T6": [363, 389], "T7": [553, 573], "T8": [581, 593], "T10": [720, 735], "T11": [740, 752], "T12": [845, 848], "T13": [861, 881], "T14": [883, 886], "T15": [1046, 1060], "T16": [1073, 1101], "T17": [1138, 1141], "T18": [1175, 1186], "T20": [1372, 1386], "T21": [1720, 1723], "T24": [14, 32], "T27": [1022, 1026], "T28": [715, 719], "T29": [504, 517], "T31": [355, 357], "T32": [178, 180], "T33": [181, 183], "T34": [223, 235], "T35": [1103, 1109], "T36": [1629, 1635], "T37": [1408, 1414], "T38": [1661, 1674], "T39": [659, 672], "T40": [1334, 1340], "T22": [1733, 1743], "T23": [400, 411], "T9": [1703, 1716], "T19": [1793, 1802], "T25": [1803, 1815]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Equivalent"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["T10", "T28"]}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "The magnetic field-modulated microwave absorption near T c has been studied in high-quality single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (T c \u2248 90 K) and in BiSrCaCuO (T c \u2248 85 K) as a function of magnetic field B < 1.3 T and orientation.

The magnetic induction due to the superconductors is calculated by the current vector potential method based on the critical state model.

This result may allow us to gain insight into why T c increases without changing a carrier-doping level by the Y substitution for La.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Characterization", "T3": "SC", "T4": "Main", "T5": "Element", "T6": "Element", "T7": "Element", "T8": "Element", "T9": "SC", "T10": "Element", "T11": "SC", "T12": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Element", "T16": "Characterization", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Element", "T24": "SC", "T25": "Property", "T26": "SC", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Element", "T30": "Element", "T31": "SC", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "SC", "T39": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Value", "T43": "Value", "T44": "Value", "T48": "Value", "T49": "Value", "T51": "Element", "T2": "Element", "T52": "Property", "T53": "Value", "T54": "Property", "T55": "Element", "T56": "Material", "T46": "Property", "T20": "Characterization", "T27": "Doping", "T35": "Doping", "T38": "Value", "T40": "Value", "T45": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [10, 13], "T3": [34, 49], "T4": [50, 60], "T5": [65, 67], "T6": [69, 71], "T7": [73, 82], "T8": [88, 104], "T9": [106, 109], "T10": [120, 130], "T11": [132, 135], "T12": [219, 223], "T13": [224, 234], "T14": [240, 243], "T15": [258, 262], "T16": [263, 266], "T17": [286, 288], "T18": [289, 298], "T19": [307, 323], "T21": [353, 365], "T22": [370, 385], "T23": [434, 451], "T24": [453, 456], "T25": [480, 488], "T26": [510, 513], "T28": [563, 564], "T29": [569, 571], "T30": [626, 636], "T31": [638, 641], "T32": [673, 689], "T33": [697, 708], "T34": [747, 748], "T36": [766, 768], "T37": [820, 823], "T39": [881, 882], "T41": [900, 902], "T42": [137, 140], "T43": [111, 114], "T44": [643, 646], "T48": [458, 461], "T49": [593, 596], "T51": [62, 64], "T2": [23, 27], "T52": [170, 182], "T53": [183, 186], "T54": [211, 218], "T55": [489, 491], "T56": [492, 496], "T46": [853, 860], "T20": [154, 166], "T27": [547, 559], "T35": [749, 761], "T38": [529, 532], "T40": [536, 539], "T45": [883, 895]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Equivalent", "R2": "Equivalent", "R3": "Equivalent", "R4": "Equivalent", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Target", "R8": "Target", "R9": "Target", "R10": "Equivalent", "R11": "Equivalent", "R12": "Condition", "R13": "Target", "R14": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["T31", "T44"], "R2": ["T24", "T48"], "R3": ["T9", "T43"], "R4": ["T11", "T42"], "R5": ["T43", "T8"], "R6": ["T42", "T10"], "R7": ["T48", "T23"], "R8": ["T44", "T30"], "R9": ["E1", "T23"], "R10": ["T26", "T38"], "R11": ["T26", "T40"], "R12": ["T40", "E1"], "R13": ["T40", "T23"], "R14": ["T38", "T30"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T27", "E2": "T35", "E3": "T45"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T28"], ["Site", "T29"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T34"], ["Site", "T36"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T39"], ["Site", "T41"]]}}, {"text": "Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles and Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca2Cu3O10-\u03b4 (CuTl-1223) superconducting phase were prepared by sol-gel and solid-state reaction methods, respectively.

Based on crystal structure analysis by particle swarm optimization methodology, NaBC is predicted to crystallize in the layered P 6 3 / m m c crystal structure as LiBC. However, it is different from LiBC, in that Na atoms are effectively ionized, with no longitudinal covalence exist between Na and B\u2013C layers, just as in the case of MgB2. Therefore, Na1\u2212x BC is more similar to MgB2 than Li1\u2212x BC as a potential high-temperature superconductor. Further more, we suggest that the slight hole doping of NaBC through partial substitution of C by B atoms can also produce cause superconductivity. The phonon spectra for NaBC and NaB1.1C0.9 are obtained within the virtual-crystal approximation treatment. There is a remarkable softening of the in-plane B\u2013C bond-stretching modes for NaB1.1C0.9 in certain regions of the Brillouin zone, while other phonon bands show no obvious softening behavior. This conspicuous softening of the in-plane B\u2013C bond-stretching modes indicates a strong electron\u2013phonon coupling for them.

Here, bridging these two effects in order to see how they can interplay, we investigate how the dc resistivity varies in both pure and CNT-doped polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 (Y-123) compounds under hydrostatic pressure. We demonstrate that the broadening of the resistivity transition in the CNT-doped samples (of 0.7wt%) is smaller than the undoped samples. In addition, by increasing applied pressure, the doped samples exhibit a higher rate of the increase of the transition temperatures T c on and T c mid than the undoped samples. Interestingly as well, under applied pressure of 1.5GPa, it is found that T c on for the doped samples (99.39K) is relatively higher than in the undoped samples (96.88K). The doped samples also show more robustness versus applied pressure in the sense that they have smaller variations of resistivity. In particular, we observed that the increase rate of the normal resistivity in the CNT-doped samples is nearly four times smaller than the undoped samples. This may be a manifestation of relative robustness of the doped samples against fractures of the links between grains. These observations, overall, may suggest that the CNT doping, due to unique mechanical characteristics of CNTs, can enhance superconductivity properties of Y-123 superconductors under applied pressure.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Process", "T3": "Element", "T5": "SC", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Main", "T12": "Main", "T13": "Process", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Element", "T18": "Process", "T20": "SC", "T24": "Process", "T25": "SC", "T29": "Process", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Material", "T38": "SC", "T39": "Element", "T40": "SC", "T41": "Process", "T4": "Element", "T6": "Value", "T7": "Value", "T8": "Property", "T43": "Value", "T44": "Value", "T45": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T47": "Element", "T2": "Doping", "T9": "Doping", "T16": "Doping", "T19": "Doping", "T23": "Doping", "T26": "Doping", "T27": "Doping", "T28": "Doping", "T33": "Doping", "T17": "SC", "T21": "SC"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [32, 40], "T3": [52, 69], "T5": [109, 141], "T10": [288, 303], "T11": [304, 315], "T12": [317, 322], "T13": [340, 360], "T14": [404, 426], "T15": [434, 437], "T18": [528, 544], "T20": [609, 632], "T24": [707, 723], "T25": [752, 755], "T29": [900, 916], "T30": [967, 978], "T31": [1044, 1055], "T35": [1216, 1225], "T36": [1247, 1253], "T38": [1379, 1396], "T39": [1411, 1416], "T40": [1417, 1432], "T41": [1439, 1455], "T4": [71, 75], "T6": [456, 462], "T7": [840, 846], "T8": [239, 253], "T43": [727, 733], "T44": [782, 788], "T45": [1361, 1365], "T32": [1063, 1066], "T37": [1305, 1308], "T47": [278, 281], "T2": [45, 51], "T9": [282, 287], "T16": [438, 443], "T19": [550, 555], "T23": [767, 772], "T26": [853, 858], "T27": [1067, 1072], "T28": [1194, 1199], "T33": [1309, 1315], "T17": [633, 639], "T21": [644, 651]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Equivalent", "R4": "Equivalent", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Condition", "R7": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["T25", "T7"], "R4": ["T25", "T44"], "R5": ["E2", "T11"], "R6": ["T44", "E5"], "R7": ["E9", "T39"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping", "E8": "Doping", "E9": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T2", "E2": "T9", "E3": "T16", "E4": "T19", "E5": "T23", "E6": "T26", "E7": "T27", "E8": "T28", "E9": "T33"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T3"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T47"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T15"]], "E4": [], "E5": [], "E6": [], "E7": [["Dopant", "T32"]], "E8": [], "E9": [["Dopant", "T37"]]}}, {"text": "Preparation conditions for stabilizing the bulk superconductivity (Tc=9.5 K) in the nominal Bi2Sr2CuO\u223c6 composition corresponding to the n=1 phase in the Bi2Sr2Can\u22121CunO2n+4 system are described.

Similarly, rare-earth compound LaSn3 has been reported to exhibit superconductivity around 6.25 K, whereas the non-magnetic YSn3 is a superconductor with Tc of 7 K. The substitution of 13th group In-atoms by 14th group Sn-atoms is seen to enhance Tc by nearly one order, although the lattice parameters increase by \u223c1.0% in YSn3 compared to YIn3 compound. It is observed from the ground state properties that the slight difference in the energy band structures of YIn3, YIn2Sn and YSn3 gives rise to various complex Fermi surfaces which are multiply connected and exhibit vast differences. The Fermi level lies on a sharp peak in YSn3 which has a higher density of states N(EF), whereas Fermi level lies on the shoulder of a sharp peak in YIn3. The electron localization function (ELF) and difference charge density maps clearly illustrate the difference in the nature of bonding; the YSn bonds are clearly more ionic (due to larger bond length) than YIn bonds. These results are consistent with the Bader charges which show loss of charges from Y-atoms and a gain of charges by In/Sn atoms. The dynamical properties also clearly illustrate the difference in the nature of bonds in YX3 intermetallics. A softening of the lowermost acoustic modes is observed in YIn3, whereas all the modes in YSn3 are observed to have positive frequencies which imply its greater stability. Since \u03bbel-ph < 1, both YIn3 and YSn3 compounds exhibit type I superconductivity according to BCS theory. However, the smaller N(EF) obtained from the density of states (DOS); the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bbel-ph obtained from the temperature dependent specific heat as well as the instability in phonon modes due to stronger YIn and InIn bonds in YIn3 may be the cause of lower Tc and filamentary nature of superconductivity. Insertion of Sn-atom in the YIn3 lattice further consolidates the superconducting nature due to increase in N(EF) and \u03b3 (electronic component of specific heat), along with lowering of the frequency of imaginary modes from 5.6 THz to 1.5\u20130.6 THz.

We have analyzed the behavior of the GBs from the systematic evolution of the values of Tgcp (p, y), Tc (p, y), and from the contribution to the field-dependent ACS signal coming from the intergrain shielding current. Zn suppresses both Tc and Tgcp in a similar fashion. The hole content and the carrier localization due to Zn substitution seem to have significant effect on the coupling properties of the GBs.

However, our magnetic and transport studies reveal a significant reduction of both superconducting transition temperature and upper critical field [T c and BC2 (0)] upon Sn intercalation.

A larger zero-field resistivity value in magnetic perovskite oxide is, in many cases, favorable for obtaining high magnetoresistance.

The gluing force of the superconducting mechanism is an attraction between spin vortices on two different N\u00e9el sublattices, centered around the empty sites described in terms of fermionic holons. The spin fluctuations are described by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by the spin vortices. Due to the no-double occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between holon and spinon binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction the spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet (RVB) spinon pairs with a lowering of the spinon gap. Lowering the temperature, the approach exhibits two crossover temperatures: at the higher crossover a finite density of incoherent holon pairs are formed leading to a reduction of the hole spectral weight, while at the lower crossover a finite density of incoherent spinon RVB pairs are also formed, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs, and magnetic vortices appear in the plasma phase. Finally, at a even lower temperature the hole pairs become coherent, the magnetic vortices becoming dilute and superconductivity appears.

The flux pinning behaviour can be explained by the vortex path model, where the pinning paths are shorter in BZO doped than in BCO doped films.

This could be achieved by reducing the surface of the Bi-2212 single crystal. We took two methods to introduce the oxygen-depleted layer into the surface of Bi-2212 single crystal. One method is to introduce the oxygen-depleted layer by annealing the Bi-2212 single crystal in reductive atmosphere of H2 gas. The Pt or Au electrodes for four-terminal measurement were deposited side by side on the surface of the Bi-2212 single crystal, and the Bi-2212 with electrodes was annealed in Ar+H2 atmosphere. The resistivity-temperature (\u03c1-T) characteristics of the Bi-2212 single crystal changed from metallic (d \u03c1/dT > 0) to semiconducting (d \u03c1/dT < 0) behavior by annealing in Ar+H2 atmosphere. In addition, hysteresis loop and voltage-jump, which are peculiar to IJJs, were observed in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of the sample annealed in Ar+H2 atmosphere. It is known that Bi-2212 single crystals are reduced by H2 annealing and the superconductivity of the reduced area is suppressed. Therefore, the surface of the Bi-2212 single crystal except for the masked area with the electrodes was reduced by Ar+H2 annealing. As a result, the change in the direction of the current was caused due to the detour avoiding the reduced area, and IJJs were fabricated. Another method to introduce the oxygen-depleted layer is to deposit metals with low Gibbs free energy and raising the temperature to exceed the activation energy for oxygen ions to move from Bi-2212 single crystal to the metal. We prepared the sample on which Al with low Gibbs free energy was deposited between the voltage terminals. Here, this sample is referred to as Al/Bi-2212 structures. The \u03c1-T characteristics of the as-prepared Al/Bi-2212 structure showed metallic behavior, whereas the \u03c1-T characteristics of the Al/Bi-2212 structure showed semiconducting behavior by annealing in Ar atmosphere. Moreover, hysteresis loop and voltage-jump were observed in the I-V characteristic of the annealed Al/Bi-2212 structure in Ar atmosphere. These results show that the direction of current flow is changed from in-plane to out-of-plane by the selective reduction of the Bi-2212 single crystal due to the oxidation of the Al and that IJJs can be fabricated without etching process. The latter method is more advantageous to integration of superconducting circuit due to the high controllability of selective reduction.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T3": "Material", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Main", "T6": "Main", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Material", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Element", "T17": "Material", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Process", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Process", "T24": "Element", "T25": "Element", "T26": "Element", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Process", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Material", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Material", "T34": "Process", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Process", "T38": "Property", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Material", "T41": "Property", "T42": "Property", "T43": "Process", "T44": "Element", "T45": "Element", "T46": "Process", "T48": "Property", "T50": "Process", "T51": "Element", "T52": "Element", "T53": "Process", "T54": "Element", "T55": "Material", "T56": "Element", "T57": "Process", "T58": "SC", "T59": "Material", "T60": "Element", "T61": "Material", "T62": "Material", "T63": "Element", "T64": "Element", "T65": "Process", "T67": "Material", "T68": "Process", "T69": "Material", "T70": "Property", "T71": "Property", "T72": "Element", "T73": "Element", "T74": "Material", "T75": "Material", "T76": "Element", "T77": "Property", "T78": "Process", "T81": "Material", "T85": "Property", "T89": "Property", "T90": "Process", "T91": "Element", "T92": "Process", "T93": "Property", "T95": "Process", "T98": "Material", "T99": "Element", "T100": "Process", "T101": "Property", "T102": "Material", "T103": "Material", "T104": "Process", "T105": "Element", "T106": "Material", "T107": "Process", "T108": "Element", "T109": "SC", "T110": "Process", "T47": "Material", "T112": "Material", "T113": "Material", "T114": "Material", "T115": "Process", "T116": "Process", "T49": "Property", "T84": "Characterization", "T88": "Characterization", "T94": "Characterization", "T111": "Characterization", "T2": "Element", "T13": "Element", "T18": "Element", "T66": "Element", "T79": "Element", "T80": "Element", "T82": "Element", "T83": "Element"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 29], "T3": [115, 120], "T4": [128, 135], "T5": [143, 159], "T6": [161, 168], "T7": [170, 184], "T8": [211, 223], "T9": [248, 260], "T10": [308, 315], "T11": [323, 330], "T12": [331, 345], "T14": [400, 405], "T15": [415, 422], "T16": [426, 433], "T17": [434, 448], "T19": [497, 502], "T20": [506, 515], "T21": [520, 527], "T22": [528, 542], "T23": [556, 566], "T24": [570, 576], "T25": [582, 584], "T26": [588, 590], "T27": [591, 601], "T28": [637, 646], "T29": [667, 674], "T30": [682, 689], "T31": [690, 704], "T32": [714, 721], "T33": [727, 737], "T34": [742, 750], "T35": [754, 756], "T36": [757, 759], "T37": [760, 770], "T38": [776, 787], "T39": [829, 836], "T40": [837, 851], "T41": [865, 873], "T42": [890, 904], "T43": [930, 939], "T44": [943, 945], "T45": [946, 948], "T46": [949, 959], "T48": [974, 989], "T50": [1108, 1116], "T51": [1120, 1122], "T52": [1123, 1125], "T53": [1126, 1136], "T54": [1155, 1162], "T55": [1163, 1178], "T56": [1194, 1196], "T57": [1197, 1206], "T58": [1215, 1232], "T59": [1283, 1290], "T60": [1298, 1305], "T61": [1306, 1320], "T62": [1357, 1367], "T63": [1383, 1385], "T64": [1386, 1388], "T65": [1389, 1398], "T67": [1586, 1591], "T68": [1598, 1605], "T69": [1606, 1612], "T70": [1622, 1639], "T71": [1682, 1699], "T72": [1704, 1715], "T73": [1729, 1736], "T74": [1737, 1751], "T75": [1759, 1764], "T76": [1798, 1800], "T77": [1810, 1827], "T78": [1832, 1841], "T81": [1920, 1930], "T85": [2003, 2011], "T89": [2089, 2103], "T90": [2116, 2125], "T91": [2129, 2131], "T92": [2132, 2142], "T93": [2154, 2169], "T95": [2234, 2242], "T98": [2254, 2263], "T99": [2267, 2269], "T100": [2270, 2280], "T101": [2323, 2335], "T102": [2352, 2360], "T103": [2364, 2376], "T104": [2394, 2403], "T105": [2411, 2418], "T106": [2419, 2433], "T107": [2445, 2454], "T108": [2462, 2464], "T109": [2579, 2594], "T110": [2648, 2657], "T47": [31, 35], "T112": [1030, 1034], "T113": [1516, 1520], "T114": [2474, 2478], "T115": [2505, 2520], "T116": [61, 76], "T49": [1448, 1455], "T84": [2208, 2211], "T88": [1057, 1072], "T94": [1074, 1077], "T111": [620, 631], "T2": [99, 105], "T13": [384, 390], "T18": [481, 487], "T66": [1570, 1576], "T79": [1909, 1919], "T80": [1975, 1985], "T82": [2061, 2071], "T83": [2243, 2253]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Two similar sets of the series Y1\u2212 x Ca x Ba2Cu3OY (0.00\u2a7d x \u2a7d0.50) are prepared by two different heat treatments at the final process of calcinations. The first set is quenched in air down to room temperature (ssq); while the second is left in the furnace and slowly cooled to room temperature (sss). After that, the samples are separately sintered in two different oxygen purity (99.99% Hp and 93% Lp, respectively) to obtain four different sets called ssqHp, sssHp, ssqLp and sssLp. Then, the considered samples are tested by XRD, SEM, resistivity and microhardness (VHN) techniques. It is found that c-parameter for ssqHP and sssLP samples increases slightly with Ca doping; while orthorhombic distortion remains nearly invariant. Interestingly, unlike for ssqHp and sssLp samples, the OD decreases continuously with Ca doping in sssHp and ssqLp samples; while c-parameter increases. SEM micrographs indicate that Ca generally improve the link between superconducting grains for all set of samples. The oxygen content is gradually decreased by Ca for all set of samples and generally follow the relation, y =6.93\u22120.5x. The effective Cu valence slightly decreases, as compared to pure samples, but stays nearly independent of Ca content for all the series. The relative decrease in critical temperature T c by Ca is more in ssqHp and sssLp samples, when compared with those of sssHp and ssqLp samples. Although, an approximately linear increase in VHN with various Ca is obtained, the relative increase is more in ssqHp and sssLp samples with respect to sssHp and ssqLp samples.

Synthesis conditions show that a very small cerium doping (less than 10%) is enough to increase the domain of formation of the 2212 phase by at least 30\u00b0C. Cerium is non-magnetic in these materials and does not suppress the superconducting state of the matrix. The critical temperature T c varies non-monotonically and reaches a maximum for x\u223c0.02, before dropping to almost zero at the limit of solubility (x\u223c0.3). Results are explained by a variation of the number of holes due to the substitution of divalent calcium by tetravalent cerium. The influence of texturation of the intragranular magnetic properties was also studied. X-ray diffraction, SEM observations, AC susceptibility and magnetization measurements clearly show that these ceramics become easily textured by their simple compaction prior to sintering.

Thus, the discovery of a high critical temperature (T c) iron-based superconductor (IBSC) in 2008 was accepted with surprise in the condensed matter community and rekindled extensive study globally. IBSCs have since grown to become a new class of high-T c superconductors next to the high-T c cuprates discovered in 1986. The rapid research progress in the science and technology of IBSCs over the past decade has resulted in the accumulation of a vast amount of knowledge on IBSC materials, mechanisms, properties, and applications with the publication of more than several tens of thousands of papers. This article reviews recent progress in the technical applications (bulk magnets, thin films, and wires) of IBSCs in addition to their fundamental material characteristics. Highlights of their applications include high-field bulk magnets workable at 15\u201325K, thin films with high critical current density (J c)>1MA/cm2 at \u223c10T and 4K, and an average J c of 1.3\u00d7104 A/cm2 at 10T and 4K achieved for a 100-m-class-length wire. These achievements are based on the intrinsically advantageous properties of IBSCs such as the higher crystallographic symmetry of the superconducting phase, higher critical magnetic field, and larger critical grain boundary angle to maintain high J c.

This analysis confirms our previous proposal that these sharp S(T) peaks near T c, that were also observed by other groups, are not intrinsic and that these anomalies are probably due to the presence in the samples of small oxygen content inhomogeneities (less than 4% of the average sample oxygenation) at long length scales, which lead to inhomogeneities in the critical temperature and in the S(T) sign. Although the uncertainties on the S(T) background may introduce some ambiguity, our present analysis also confirms our earlier proposal that the intrinsic critical behavior of S(T) near T c in Y1Ba2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 compounds is mainly driven by that of the electrical conductivity, i.e., we found that the thermoelectric coefficient, L(T), of copper-oxide superconductors does not present a strong critical behavior above the superconducting transition, in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions of Maki. Also, our previous analysis of the influence on S(T) of uniformly and non-uniformly distributed oxygen content inhomogeneities is now extended to new possible experimental situations. These results show, in particular, that the strong decrease of the anomalous S(T) peak amplitude due to the presence of a magnetic field, an effect observed by various groups and that has remained unexplained until now, may be easily understood in terms of oxygen content inhomogeneities. By taking into account the dependence of the effective thermopower on the relative strength of these inhomogeneities, it is possible to explain the change of sign of S(T) observed by various authors in the normal region in some polycrystalline samples. Such a dependence also provides a simple and plausible explanation of the existing controversial experimental results concerning the possible opposite sign of S in the a and b directions of untwinned crystals.

The susceptibility feature at 12K is possibly due to CF effects rather than the magnetic order as proposed earlier. This removes the issue of the transition temperature being too large to scale properly with the de Gennes factor.

However, the MgB2 layer growth stops shortly after the onset of the heat treatment and unreacted B always remained in the MgB2 layer within MgB2 wires, negatively affecting the J e performance. Thus it is of great importance to have an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of reaction between Mg rod and B powder forming the MgB2 layer within IMD wires during heat treatment, and identify the critical factor that controls the formation rate of MgB2 layer. In present work, the kinetics mechanism of reaction between Mg and B forming MgB2 layer in the internal Mg diffusion (IMD) processed MgB2 wires were systemically studied in present work. It was found that the reaction between Mg and B forming MgB2 layer during the heating treatment is controlled by varied mechanisms. At initial stage, the formation of MgB2 layer is mainly determined by the rate of chemical reaction between liquid Mg and B powder. As the reaction processes and the thickness of synthesized MgB2 layer increases, the slow Mg diffusion-limited mechanism gradually becomes dominant at final stage. On the basis, herein Mg rod with a thin Cu coating is proposed to replace normal Mg rod in IMD procedure to accelerate the formation of MgB2 layer within wires. As a result, Cu coating can change the kinetics mechanism of MgB2 layer formation and enable the formation of MgB2 layer to get rid of the restriction of slow Mg diffusion. Complete dense MgB2 layer without B-rich or unreacted B regions was successfully synthesized within Cu coated IMD wires with larger diameter (1.03 mm) at temperature as low as 600 \u00b0C (below Mg melting point). The kinetics mechanism of MgB2 layer formation determined in our work can provide a valuable guide for optimizing processing parameters of IMD MgB2 wires. Moreover, the Cu coating technique proposed here opens a promising way to fabricate practical high performance IMD wires at low heating temperature.", "t_type_dict": {"T3": "Main", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Property", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Element", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Material", "T14": "Process", "T15": "Element", "T16": "Element", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Element", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Element", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Material", "T26": "Process", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Material", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Material", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Material", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Element", "T44": "Material", "T45": "Material", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Material", "T49": "Material", "T50": "Element", "T51": "Material", "T52": "Element", "T54": "Element", "T55": "Element", "T56": "Process", "T58": "Element", "T59": "Element", "T60": "Material", "T61": "Material", "T62": "Element", "T63": "Process", "T65": "Element", "T66": "Material", "T67": "Element", "T68": "Material", "T69": "Element", "T71": "Element", "T72": "Material", "T73": "Element", "T74": "Element", "T75": "Element", "T76": "Process", "T77": "Process", "T78": "Material", "T79": "Element", "T80": "Property", "T82": "Element", "T83": "Material", "T84": "Element", "T85": "Material", "T86": "Element", "T87": "Process", "T88": "Material", "T2": "Process", "T89": "Process", "T90": "Process", "T13": "Property", "T91": "Process", "T27": "Process", "T30": "Process", "T53": "Process", "T64": "Material", "T70": "Value", "T93": "Value", "T94": "Process", "T81": "Process", "T96": "Process", "T97": "Process", "T7": "Material", "T1": "Process"}, "t_span_dict": {"T3": [48, 52], "T4": [53, 68], "T5": [69, 74], "T6": [92, 116], "T8": [188, 193], "T9": [274, 278], "T10": [279, 284], "T11": [299, 303], "T12": [304, 309], "T14": [354, 368], "T15": [383, 384], "T16": [408, 412], "T17": [413, 418], "T18": [426, 430], "T19": [431, 436], "T20": [582, 584], "T21": [593, 594], "T22": [595, 601], "T23": [614, 618], "T24": [619, 624], "T25": [636, 641], "T26": [649, 663], "T28": [734, 738], "T29": [739, 744], "T31": [806, 808], "T32": [813, 814], "T33": [823, 827], "T34": [828, 833], "T37": [879, 883], "T38": [884, 889], "T39": [972, 974], "T40": [979, 980], "T41": [989, 993], "T42": [994, 999], "T43": [1100, 1104], "T44": [1105, 1110], "T45": [1173, 1179], "T46": [1180, 1182], "T47": [1187, 1188], "T48": [1189, 1195], "T49": [1231, 1240], "T50": [1256, 1260], "T51": [1261, 1266], "T52": [1287, 1289], "T54": [1382, 1384], "T55": [1401, 1403], "T56": [1404, 1411], "T58": [1442, 1444], "T59": [1497, 1501], "T60": [1502, 1507], "T61": [1515, 1520], "T62": [1535, 1537], "T63": [1538, 1545], "T65": [1583, 1587], "T66": [1588, 1593], "T67": [1632, 1636], "T68": [1637, 1642], "T69": [1681, 1683], "T71": [1710, 1714], "T72": [1715, 1720], "T73": [1729, 1735], "T74": [1749, 1750], "T75": [1795, 1797], "T76": [1798, 1804], "T77": [1805, 1808], "T78": [1809, 1814], "T79": [1885, 1887], "T80": [1888, 1901], "T82": [1930, 1934], "T83": [1935, 1940], "T84": [2047, 2051], "T85": [2052, 2057], "T86": [2073, 2075], "T87": [2076, 2083], "T88": [2174, 2179], "T2": [0, 21], "T89": [23, 26], "T90": [163, 177], "T13": [463, 466], "T91": [632, 635], "T27": [841, 862], "T30": [864, 867], "T53": [1452, 1455], "T64": [1704, 1709], "T70": [1837, 1844], "T93": [1871, 1877], "T94": [1849, 1860], "T81": [2043, 2046], "T96": [2170, 2173], "T97": [2183, 2206], "T7": [2018, 2039], "T1": [1011, 1028]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Quantitative evaluation of selected sets of critical temperature and lattice parameter data for the orthorhombic compounds YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x and YBa2(Cu1\u2212y , Fe y )3O7\u2212x reveals a strongly anisotropic dependence of the critical temperature on these parameters, especially for YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x . This method of deriving the relationship between critical temperature and changes in lattice constants is termed chemical pressure analysis (CPA). The signs of the anisotropic chemical pressure coefficients, k i , for the critical temperature of YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x are found to be opposite to those determined for anisotropically applied physical (mechanical) pressure and of greatly increased magnitude. One explanation for these differences may be that physical pressures do not alter chemical bonds in the same manner as do chemical pressures. For pressures below 4 GPa, both CPA and physical pressure results indicate that increasing hydrostatic pressure increases T c , but chemical pressures are found to be more effective at increasing critical temperature than are physical pressures. Hydrostatic pressures above 4 GPa, however, decrease T c .

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, DC electrical resistivity and temperature dependent ultrasonic velocity measurements. DC electrical resistivity measurement showed all the samples exhibit metallic normal-state behavior with the highest T c zero observed at around 76.4K (x=0.3). Ultrasonic velocity measurements at 80K showed a non-linear increase in both absolute longitudinal and shear velocities as well as elastic moduli with Cd substitution with the largest increase observed for the x=0.3 sample. Temperature dependant longitudinal modulus showed elastic anomaly characterized by a step-like slope change at around 230K for x=0 & x=0.3 and at around 250K for x=0.4 with the x=0.3 sample showing the sharpest slope change. A comparison between experimental data and calculated lattice anharmonicity curve based on the model proposed by Lakkad, showed large deviation of the experimental longitudinal modulus curves for (x=0.3) from the calculated anharmonicity curves indicating that the elastic behavior was strongly influenced by the existence of the step-like longitudinal anomaly. On the other hand, our analysis using the Landau free energy model found that the anomalous step-like elastic behavior fitted well with the equation derived from the model for regions below and above the elastic anomaly temperature, T A . The fitting indicated that the anomaly is related to a phase transition that is suggested to involve ordering of oxygen which introduces strain in the system.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Main", "T3": "Material", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Process", "T6": "Element", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Characterization", "T9": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "SC", "T17": "Element", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Property", "T10": "Characterization", "T12": "Value", "T37": "Value", "T39": "Characterization", "T40": "Value", "T42": "Property", "T43": "Property", "T44": "Property", "T34": "Element", "T36": "Value", "T45": "Property", "T46": "Value", "T47": "Value", "T49": "Value", "T51": "Value", "T53": "Value", "T55": "Value", "T57": "Value", "T58": "Property", "T59": "Property", "T60": "Property", "T41": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T23": "Characterization", "T18": "Doping", "T30": "Doping", "T31": "Value", "T32": "Value"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [9, 56], "T3": [67, 71], "T4": [72, 86], "T5": [112, 132], "T6": [166, 168], "T7": [196, 212], "T8": [263, 280], "T9": [282, 307], "T11": [312, 333], "T13": [368, 393], "T14": [437, 445], "T15": [446, 458], "T16": [485, 488], "T17": [679, 681], "T19": [1031, 1038], "T20": [1072, 1077], "T21": [1242, 1258], "T24": [1441, 1457], "T25": [1505, 1510], "T26": [1633, 1649], "T27": [1679, 1687], "T28": [1691, 1697], "T29": [1715, 1721], "T10": [334, 366], "T12": [513, 518], "T37": [522, 525], "T39": [528, 560], "T40": [564, 567], "T42": [605, 626], "T43": [631, 647], "T44": [659, 673], "T34": [0, 2], "T36": [740, 743], "T45": [802, 809], "T46": [870, 874], "T47": [905, 909], "T49": [916, 919], "T51": [931, 934], "T53": [881, 882], "T55": [887, 890], "T57": [1176, 1179], "T58": [1572, 1575], "T59": [1543, 1570], "T60": [172, 191], "T41": [1381, 1405], "T22": [752, 773], "T23": [394, 405], "T18": [3, 8], "T30": [682, 694], "T31": [60, 61], "T32": [62, 65]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Equivalent", "R2": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["T16", "T12"], "R2": ["E1", "T2"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T18", "E2": "T30"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T34"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T17"]]}}, {"text": "Palleted samples of YBa2Cu3O x which were quenched into Hg after equilibration at high temperatures, showed no evidence of \u223c90 K and \u223c60 K plateaux in plots of critical temperature against x.

In particular, we show that the superconducting QPI pattern vanishes at the same temperature as that at which the Fermi arcs appear. Experimental support for this conclusion comes from the observation of a nearly dispersionless QPI pattern which appears above T c in moderately underdoped cuprates. To illustrate the important two energy scale physics we present predictions of the QPI-inferred energy gaps as a function of T in moderately underdoped cuprates.

The optimization of this processing is a key step towards the successful continuation of the superconducting materials development, i.e. in substitutions, c-axis orientation, melt-sintering processes, and in synthesizing single crystals. An example of optimized bulk substitution is the 70% limit of Sr for Ba substitution in the yttrium-based 123 superconductor. In a nominal composition containing no barium, a majority 123 phase has also been observed, though this phase is apparently not superconducting. In the Bi-based system, substitution of Sb and Pb for Bi has been obtained in the 2223 phase. The Sb substitution into the pure phase has no apparent advantage over the parent Bi compound or the Pb-substituted phase. Orientation/melt-sintering effects include the extreme c-axis orientation of yttrium 123 and of the bisumuth 2223, 2212 and 2201 phases. Surface orientation of all three Bi-based phases can be obtained from one sample of a specific nominal bulk composition. The surface orientation for both series of samples is dependent upon a number of factors including pre- heat processing, exact composition and/or extraneous phases present, heat rates, temperatures, and times. A procedure for establishing Sr substitution for Ba into 123 single crystals has been determined. Systematic substitution of up to 30% Sr for Ba in the structure has been successful. This procedure as well as those above will be described and discussed.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "SC", "T3": "Process", "T5": "SC", "T7": "Material", "T9": "Process", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Material", "T14": "SC", "T15": "SC", "T19": "Material", "T21": "Process", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Material", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Material", "T26": "Material", "T27": "Material", "T30": "Material", "T32": "Main", "T2": "Element", "T34": "Element", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Value", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Element", "T44": "Element", "T45": "Element", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T52": "Element", "T53": "Element", "T54": "Element", "T55": "Element", "T56": "Value", "T57": "Element", "T58": "Element", "T50": "Element", "T4": "Process", "T6": "Doping", "T8": "Doping", "T12": "Doping", "T13": "Doping", "T16": "Doping", "T17": "Doping", "T18": "Doping", "T20": "Doping", "T28": "Main", "T29": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T49": "Process"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [52, 67], "T3": [278, 294], "T5": [411, 426], "T7": [480, 491], "T9": [493, 507], "T10": [539, 554], "T11": [580, 584], "T14": [666, 680], "T15": [810, 825], "T19": [1044, 1055], "T21": [1056, 1070], "T22": [1106, 1117], "T23": [1181, 1188], "T24": [1189, 1200], "T25": [1284, 1288], "T26": [1306, 1313], "T27": [1314, 1325], "T30": [1573, 1588], "T32": [30, 33], "T2": [271, 277], "T34": [618, 620], "T35": [625, 627], "T36": [648, 665], "T37": [740, 749], "T38": [605, 608], "T39": [721, 727], "T40": [867, 869], "T41": [834, 836], "T42": [874, 876], "T43": [881, 883], "T44": [909, 919], "T45": [925, 927], "T46": [1022, 1024], "T47": [1003, 1005], "T48": [1121, 1132], "T52": [1214, 1216], "T53": [1541, 1543], "T54": [1561, 1563], "T55": [1569, 1572], "T56": [1643, 1646], "T57": [1647, 1649], "T58": [1654, 1656], "T50": [231, 233], "T4": [1401, 1421], "T6": [458, 471], "T8": [585, 597], "T12": [628, 640], "T13": [851, 863], "T16": [928, 940], "T17": [1025, 1036], "T18": [1544, 1556], "T20": [1621, 1633], "T28": [38, 51], "T29": [1144, 1157], "T31": [1159, 1163], "T33": [1168, 1179], "T49": [92, 111]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target", "R2": "Target", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E3", "T36"], "R2": ["E4", "T44"], "R3": ["E7", "T55"], "R4": ["E9", "T44"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping", "E8": "Doping", "E9": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T6", "E2": "T8", "E3": "T12", "E4": "T13", "E5": "T16", "E6": "T17", "E7": "T18", "E8": "T20", "E9": "T13"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": [], "E3": [["Dopant", "T34"], ["Site", "T35"]], "E4": [["Dopant", "T40"], ["Site", "T43"]], "E5": [["Dopant", "T45"]], "E6": [["Dopant", "T46"]], "E7": [["Dopant", "T53"], ["Site", "T54"]], "E8": [["Dopant", "T57"], ["Site", "T58"]], "E9": [["Dopant", "T42"], ["Site", "T43"]]}}, {"text": "The Van Hove singularity (VHS) provides a paradigm for the study of the role of peaks in the density of states (dos) on electronic properties. More importantly, it appears to play a major role in the physics of the high-T c superconductors, particularly since recent photoemission studies have found that the VHS is close to the Fermi level in most of the high-T c cuprates near the composition of optimum T c . This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the VHS model, describing both theoretical properties and experimental evidence for the picture. Special topics discussed include a survey of the Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and related compounds, and an analysis of the reliability of the slave boson approach to correlation effects. While many properties of the cuprates can be qualitatively understood by a simple rigid-band-filling model, this is inadequate for more quantitative results, since correlation effects tend to pin the Fermi level near the VHS over an extended doping range, and can lead to a nanoscale phase separation. Furthermore, the peaks in the dos lead to competition from other instabilities, both magnetic and structural (related to charge density waves). A novel form of dynamic structural instability, involving dynamic VHS-Jahn-Teller effects has been predicted. Scattered through the literature, there is considerable experimental evidence for both nanoscale phase separation of holes, and for local, possibly dynamic, structural disorder. This review attempts to gather these results into a comprehensive database, to sort the results, and to see how they fit into the Van Hove scenario. Recent experiments on underdoped cuprates are found to provide a strong confirmation that the pseudogap is driven by a splitting of the VHS degeneracy.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T4": "Characterization", "T5": "Property", "T6": "SC", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Property", "T10": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Material", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Property", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T30": "Material", "T31": "Property", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Material", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Element", "T2": "SC", "T3": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [93, 110], "T4": [267, 280], "T5": [329, 340], "T6": [356, 364], "T7": [406, 409], "T8": [464, 469], "T10": [844, 849], "T11": [943, 954], "T13": [1110, 1123], "T14": [1130, 1138], "T15": [1143, 1153], "T16": [1166, 1180], "T17": [1213, 1223], "T18": [1224, 1235], "T19": [1416, 1421], "T20": [1456, 1475], "T21": [772, 780], "T22": [624, 632], "T23": [365, 373], "T24": [112, 115], "T25": [4, 24], "T26": [26, 29], "T27": [964, 967], "T28": [460, 463], "T29": [309, 312], "T9": [602, 616], "T30": [1017, 1026], "T31": [1255, 1270], "T32": [1607, 1624], "T33": [1762, 1765], "T34": [825, 843], "T35": [1075, 1078], "T36": [1386, 1412], "T37": [1720, 1729], "T38": [1659, 1667], "T2": [215, 239], "T3": [985, 991]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T3"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": []}}, {"text": "We report the doping dependence of transport and magnetic properties in Co-doped BaFe 2 As 2 .

In the previous Poynting's vector methods, for a short straight case two sets of both potential lead pairs and pickup coils were rotated around tapes in order to measure local energy flow densities, i.e., the distribution of Poynting's vector; for a solenoidal coil case two sets of both potential lead coils and spiral pickup coils were shifted to the coil axis direction by one winding pitch of the solenoidal coil. During moving these sets at low temperature, the data acquisition system was working and the value of ac losses was finally obtained. These previous methods, therefore, have inconveniences such as much time to get the value, much space needed for moving sets, or frequent troubles of movements due to low temperature deformation.

As a result, immovable arrays of sets can be rigidly arranged, so that the signal measured at each position can be simultaneously.

Effective flux pinning centers with various physical properties were artificially introduced into the superconducting matrix to enhance the flux pinning capability.

However, almost no change in the T c (onset) for all samples was observed. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the remanent magnetization, M R reveal a nonmonotonic behavior with the nano-NiO addition. A clear enhancement of the pinning strength was observed for the sample with x = 0.002 at quite high temperature ( T = 90 K). These results were discussed in terms of the interaction of the magnetic nanoparticles with the superconducting matrix especially at elevated temperatures close to T c and above the depinning line.

Magnetization measurements were carried out on a series of YBa2Cu3O x -AgO ceramic superconductors, with T c\u224893 K. The samples were from the set of samples in which the magnetic-suspension phenomenon was first discovered. Magnetization data were taken at 4.2 and 77 K in magnetic fields up to 180 kOe. Hysteresis loops at low fields, up to 1.2 kOe, were also studied at 4.2, 77 and 87 to 88 K. The magnetization and hysteresis in most of the samples are among the largest observed to date in ceramic high-T c superconductors. In most of our samples, the remanent moment at 4.2 K is about 80 emu/g, and about 3 emu/g at 77 K. The large magnetization and hysteresis indicate the presence of strong pinning forces. The strong hysteresis at 77 K results in an appreciable positive magnetization, parallel to the field, when the field H is decreased from a finite value (above\u22480.5 kOe). This positive magnetization increases with decreasing H. The positive magnetization can be produced by bringing a permanent magnet close to the superconductor, and then withdrawing it slowly. This leads to an attractive magnetic force between the superconductor and the permanent magnet. Calculations, based on a realistic model, show that at 77 K this magnetic attraction can be sufficiently strong to balance the gravitational force. As a result, the superconductor can be suspended below a permanent magnet. The expected damped oscillatory motion near the suspension point, following the application of a vertical impulse to the superconductor, is discussed. This motion is more complicated than that near the bottom of a conventional potential well.

The magnetic behavior of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was determined by MH-loops with the help of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). MH-loops analysis showed that these nanoparticles exhibit high saturation magnetization (86emu/g) and high coercivity (3350Oe) at 50K. The tetragonal structure of host CuTl-1223 superconducting matrix was not altered after the addition of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, which gave us a clue that these nanoparticles had occupied the inter-granular sites (grain-boundaries) and had filled the pores.

The resistivity versus temperature measurements showed an increase in zero resistivity critical {T c(0)}, which could be most probably due to improvement of weak-links by the addition of these nanoparticles.

This means the superconductors need time to recover the superconducting properties and be ready for the next short fault. So the recovery characteristics become one of the most crucial features of the resistive type SFCL. In this paper, several different kinds of measuring methods are presented to calculate the recovery time of the HTS tapes, and comparison of these methods is also carried out by a standard test. On basis of this, samples with different kinds of stabilizers are used to explore the influence of stabilizer on their recovery characteristics. In addition, the influence of the encapsulation technology is also discussed in this paper.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "SC", "T2": "Material", "T3": "SC", "T5": "SC", "T6": "SC", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Property", "T10": "Process", "T14": "Material", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Process", "T18": "Process", "T19": "Process", "T20": "Process", "T21": "Property", "T4": "Material"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [19, 34], "T2": [35, 40], "T3": [93, 108], "T5": [269, 284], "T6": [366, 381], "T7": [407, 422], "T8": [466, 471], "T9": [480, 488], "T11": [664, 672], "T12": [685, 688], "T13": [887, 895], "T10": [947, 960], "T14": [818, 829], "T16": [41, 48], "T17": [58, 62], "T18": [292, 296], "T19": [567, 571], "T20": [161, 165], "T21": [225, 236], "T4": [867, 877]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Since the discovery of graphene many studies focused on its functionalization by different methods. These strategies aim to find new pathways to overcome the main drawback of graphene, a missing band-gap, which strongly reduces its potential applications, particularly in the domain of nanoelectronics, despite its huge and unequaled charge carrier mobility. The necessity to contact this material with a metal has motivated a lot of studies of metal/graphene interactions and has led to the discovery of the intercalation process very early in the history of graphene. Intercalation, where the deposited atoms do not stay at the graphene surface but intercalate between the top layer and the substrate, may happen at room temperature or be induced by annealing, depending of the chemical nature of the metal. This kind of mechanism was already well-known in the earlier Graphite Intercalation Compounds (GICs), particularly famous for one current application, the Lithium-ion Battery, which is simply an application based on the intercalation of Lithium atoms between two sheets of graphene in a graphite anode. Among numerous discoveries the GICs community also found a way to obtain graphite with superconducting properties by using intercalated alkali metals. Graphene is now a playground to \u201crevisit\u201d and understand all these mechanisms and to discover possible new properties of graphene induced by intercalation. For example, the intercalation process may be used to decouple the graphene layer from its substrate, to change its doping level or even, in a more general way, to modify its electronic band structure and the nature of its Dirac fermions. In this paper we will focus on the functionalization of graphene by using intercalation of metal atoms but also of molecules. We will give an overview of the induced modifications of the electronic band structure possibly leading to spin-orbit coupling, superconductivity, \u2026We will see how this concept of functionalization is also now used in the framework of other 2D materials beyond graphene and of van der Waals heterostructures based on these materials.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Element", "T2": "Element", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Property", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Element", "T12": "Element", "T15": "Material", "T17": "Element", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Process", "T22": "Process", "T23": "Material", "T24": "Element", "T26": "Material", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Material", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "SC", "T38": "Element", "T39": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Material", "T44": "Material", "T47": "Property", "T48": "Element", "T52": "Material", "T53": "Material", "T55": "Property", "T56": "Property", "T57": "SC", "T58": "Material", "T59": "Element", "T60": "Material", "T61": "Material", "T16": "Element", "T62": "Material", "T51": "Property", "T25": "Element", "T46": "Property", "T14": "Element", "T50": "Property", "T11": "Doping", "T13": "Doping", "T27": "Doping", "T35": "Doping", "T40": "Doping", "T41": "Element", "T45": "Doping", "T49": "Doping", "T54": "Doping", "T63": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [23, 31], "T2": [175, 183], "T3": [195, 203], "T4": [276, 282], "T5": [334, 348], "T6": [349, 357], "T7": [389, 397], "T8": [405, 410], "T9": [445, 450], "T10": [451, 459], "T12": [560, 568], "T15": [595, 610], "T17": [630, 638], "T18": [639, 646], "T19": [675, 684], "T20": [693, 702], "T21": [718, 734], "T22": [752, 761], "T23": [803, 808], "T24": [871, 903], "T26": [977, 984], "T28": [1047, 1054], "T29": [1055, 1060], "T30": [1073, 1079], "T31": [1083, 1091], "T32": [1097, 1105], "T33": [1144, 1148], "T34": [1200, 1215], "T38": [1264, 1272], "T39": [1385, 1393], "T42": [1487, 1495], "T43": [1496, 1501], "T44": [1511, 1520], "T47": [1595, 1620], "T48": [1715, 1723], "T52": [1750, 1761], "T53": [1774, 1783], "T55": [1846, 1871], "T56": [1892, 1911], "T57": [1913, 1930], "T58": [2029, 2038], "T59": [2046, 2054], "T60": [2062, 2092], "T61": [2108, 2117], "T16": [965, 976], "T62": [1106, 1111], "T51": [2026, 2028], "T25": [905, 909], "T46": [286, 301], "T14": [1186, 1194], "T50": [1643, 1657], "T11": [509, 522], "T13": [570, 583], "T27": [651, 662], "T35": [1030, 1043], "T40": [1236, 1248], "T41": [1249, 1262], "T45": [1405, 1418], "T49": [1437, 1450], "T54": [1536, 1542], "T63": [1733, 1746]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Target", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["E4", "T32"], "R3": ["E9", "T48"], "R4": ["E10", "T48"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping", "E8": "Doping", "E9": "Doping", "E10": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T11", "E2": "T13", "E3": "T27", "E4": "T35", "E5": "T40", "E6": "T45", "E7": "T49", "E8": "T54", "E9": "T63", "E10": "T63"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": [], "E3": [], "E4": [["Dopant", "T28"], ["Site", "T31"]], "E5": [["Site", "T41"]], "E6": [], "E7": [], "E8": [], "E9": [["Dopant", "T52"]], "E10": [["Dopant", "T53"]]}}, {"text": "The in\ufb02uence of CuFe2O4 nanoparticle doping on superconducting properties of Fe-sheated MgB2 wires has been studied.

Lattice thermal conductivity analyzed using Callaway\u2019s expression indicates that it is mainly governed by phonon scattering from boundary, point defects and sheet-like faults. However, dominant role is played by phonon scattering from sheet like faults, which decides the lattice thermal conductivity of both pure and 2223 added MgB2.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "Main", "T3": "Element", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Process", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Material", "T11": "Characterization", "T13": "Element", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T17": "SC", "T18": "SC", "T19": "Element", "T20": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Property", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Property", "T29": "Element", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Property", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T35": "SC", "T36": "Property", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Material", "T41": "Material", "T42": "Property", "T43": "Property", "T44": "Element", "T45": "Property", "T46": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T49": "Material", "T50": "Property", "T51": "Property", "T52": "Material", "T53": "Material", "T54": "Material", "T55": "Property", "T56": "Material", "T57": "Material", "T58": "Material", "T59": "Property", "T60": "Element", "T61": "Element", "T25": "Element", "T10": "Value", "T63": "Value", "T64": "Value", "T65": "Value", "T66": "Characterization", "T67": "Property", "T68": "Property", "T69": "Element", "T12": "Doping", "T16": "Doping", "T21": "Doping", "T28": "Doping", "T37": "Doping", "T38": "Doping", "T47": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 15], "T2": [16, 20], "T3": [78, 104], "T4": [107, 122], "T5": [123, 129], "T6": [154, 174], "T7": [176, 192], "T8": [231, 241], "T9": [265, 281], "T11": [283, 286], "T13": [355, 359], "T14": [372, 378], "T15": [383, 391], "T17": [428, 450], "T18": [452, 454], "T19": [460, 464], "T20": [501, 505], "T22": [518, 522], "T23": [524, 546], "T24": [550, 570], "T26": [647, 649], "T27": [678, 698], "T29": [740, 744], "T30": [820, 830], "T31": [849, 869], "T32": [875, 879], "T33": [896, 906], "T34": [907, 927], "T35": [931, 946], "T36": [974, 980], "T39": [1043, 1047], "T40": [1064, 1071], "T41": [1072, 1080], "T42": [1118, 1128], "T43": [1152, 1162], "T44": [1176, 1180], "T45": [1201, 1211], "T46": [1215, 1219], "T48": [1260, 1264], "T49": [1266, 1273], "T50": [1274, 1294], "T51": [1372, 1389], "T52": [1405, 1418], "T53": [1423, 1428], "T54": [1434, 1440], "T55": [1478, 1495], "T56": [1501, 1506], "T57": [1512, 1518], "T58": [1538, 1545], "T59": [1546, 1566], "T60": [1584, 1588], "T61": [1595, 1599], "T25": [63, 76], "T10": [53, 59], "T63": [40, 41], "T64": [46, 47], "T65": [43, 44], "T66": [408, 413], "T67": [752, 773], "T68": [1310, 1331], "T69": [1035, 1039], "T12": [29, 39], "T16": [309, 321], "T21": [506, 514], "T28": [728, 736], "T37": [1023, 1031], "T38": [1248, 1256], "T47": [1589, 1594]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Target", "R4": "Target", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["E1", "T2"], "R4": ["E3", "T22"], "R5": ["E5", "T39"], "R6": ["E7", "T61"], "R7": ["E6", "T46"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T12", "E2": "T16", "E3": "T21", "E4": "T28", "E5": "T37", "E6": "T38", "E7": "T47"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T25"]], "E2": [], "E3": [["Dopant", "T20"]], "E4": [["Dopant", "T29"]], "E5": [["Dopant", "T69"]], "E6": [["Dopant", "T48"]], "E7": [["Dopant", "T60"]]}}, {"text": "We report on the growth procedure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 and Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b3 single crystals.

After quenching from a high temperature, a pronounced {1,1} micro-twinning appears. It starts from a fine irregular tweed-like pattern, with the spacing between domain walls becoming more regular while coarsening during the anneal.

The real and imaginary components of \u03c7AC versus T data revealed that a second transition appeared below the onset of superconductivity at T c, possibly due to the weak superconducting links that make up the intergranular regions. This second transition is strongly dependent on the applied magnetic field H, and it shifts towards higher temperatures with x.

For this purpose, five films prepared by DC-sputtering on MgO substrates were annealed for 1 h at 500\u00b0 C in different oxygen pressures between 80 and 1000 mbar. The degree of oxygen disorder was varied by a change of the cooling procedure or a subsequent annealing at 250\u00b0 C. The absolute values as well as the slope of the resistivity in the normal conducting state and the penetration depth in the superconducting state are continuously increasing with \u03b4. The transition temperatures change only slowly and a maximum in T c vs. \u03b4 occurs. As a main result, we observe a strong influence of \u03b4 on the surface resistance below 0.8T c which first increases at the maximum of T c and then decreases for higher oxygen deficiencies. Oxygen disorder leads to a degradation of all measured quantities, but R s was found to be most affected. These observations can be explained in the context of a recent model by Kresin and Wolf which proposes two conductive subsystems and, as a result, a two-gap structure of YBCO. Charge transfer between the Cu-O planes and chains leads to an induced superconducting state in the chains. Oxygen content and order affect the value of the smaller energy gap of the chains, which in turn has a large impact on R s .

In this review, we would like to convey a snapshot of the current application of the STM in the research of HTSC, mainly focusing on the studies using the spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) which eventually led to the scanning Josephson tunneling microscopy (SJTM) by which we can visualize the superconducting Cooper pairs in an atomic scale.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "SC", "T2": "SC", "T3": "Element", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Element", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Element", "T9": "SC", "T11": "SC", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Characterization", "T14": "Characterization", "T15": "Characterization", "T16": "SC", "T17": "Characterization", "T18": "SC", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T10": "Element", "T19": "Characterization", "T20": "Characterization", "T21": "Characterization", "T25": "Characterization", "T26": "Process", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Characterization"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [40, 74], "T2": [76, 80], "T3": [91, 98], "T4": [166, 178], "T5": [194, 200], "T6": [201, 209], "T7": [297, 301], "T8": [316, 320], "T9": [327, 342], "T11": [479, 483], "T12": [643, 658], "T13": [673, 702], "T14": [704, 707], "T15": [893, 903], "T16": [926, 930], "T17": [1044, 1047], "T18": [1067, 1071], "T22": [1280, 1295], "T23": [1296, 1308], "T10": [659, 667], "T19": [1114, 1165], "T20": [1167, 1173], "T21": [1203, 1242], "T25": [1244, 1248], "T26": [210, 229], "T27": [1315, 1327], "T28": [844, 863]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Here, we study the magnetism of the distorted 1 T - TcX 2 (X = S,Se) based on first-principles calculation.

These samples are single phase to within 4%, the resolution of our X-ray diffraction measurements, but they are not fully oxygenated, their transition temperatures being around 90 K. The corresponding longitudinal resistivity curves, p(T), do not present any anomalous peak. The anomalous S(T) peak disappears after a new oxygen annealing of the samples, which also increases somewhat their T c whereas their corresponding S(T) become negative. By using mean field approaches of the effective medium theory, we show here that this type of sharp S(T) peak above T c may be explained at a quantitative level by the presence in the samples of small T c inhomogeneities, at long length scales and uniformly distributed, associated with small (less than 4%) oxygen content inhomogeneities. These results confirm our previous proposals that the intrinsic critical behaviour of S(T) is driven by that of the electrical conductivity, i.e., that the thermoelectric coefficient, L, of copper-oxide superconductors does not present any sharp critical divergence above the superconducting transition. An example of the influence on S(T) of a non-uniformly distributed T c inhomogeneity is also analyzed here.

Sections 1 and 2 summarize the most important physical properties of these systems, based on the main theoretical results achieved so far and on representative data. In the main part (section 3) we summarize neutron scattering data of VF and HF systems. By means of neutrons one can measure the magnetic structure of a system (elastic magnetic scattering) and magnetic and non-magnetic excitations such as relaxational modes (quasi-elastic excitations), magnons, crystal field, and spin-orbit transitions, and phonons. Some of these excitations have been observed in all VF or HF systems. Both VF and HF systems exhibit a quasi-elastic line due to spin fluctuations or the Kondo effect. Both expressions are used synonymously, but in VF systems the quasi-elastic line is quite broad, corresponding to a high characteristic energy, and is fairly temperature independent. Here one speaks in general about spin fluctuations. In HF systems the quasi-elastic line is narrower, temperature dependent, and has, at low temperatures, an halfwidth 1/2\u0393 \u22cd k B T N K. A typical quasi-elastic line can be fitted by a Lorentzian and corresponds to a single relaxation time. In most HF compounds the line becomes Q-dependent at low temperatures, indicating spin correlations that at still lower temperatures often lead to magnetic order. These spin correlations, on the other hand, lead already to deviations from the Lorentz shape above the spin-ordering temperature. In VF compounds spin correlations do not play a role, but the high-temperature quasi-elastic line also changes shape and becomes narrower and inelastic at low temperatures. Ce-based HF systems have been investigated by many groups, whereas few data exist for the corresponding VF systems and for Yb-, Sm-, Eu-, and Tm-based VF and HF systems. As a consequence, our survey over Ce-based VF and Yb, Sm, Eu, and Tm systems is rather complete, whereas for Ce-based HF systems we could only select representative examples. Part of this strong research activity on Ce compounds is due to the fact that CeCu2Si2 becomes superconducting, and it is an enormous challenge to find other superconducting HF systems. In addition, one has in these systems a variety of magnetic structures, such as ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and spiral order and metamagnetism. In many cases the detection of these structures is hampered by moments that are strongly reduced by the Kondo effect. In addition to the Kondo effect one has in HF systems strong crystal field effects, and the corresponding 4f-levels can be determined by neutron scattering experiments. The interplay between Kondo and CF effects varies from system to system, and the corresponding information is part of the content of this chapter. Since in HF systems the Kondo temperature is typically rather small, one observes at low temperature mainly the properties of the lowest CF level. Valence fluctuations couple to phonons, and our review gives a rather complete survey of the corresponding anomalies. In addition, one has phonon anomalies due to the CF-phonon interaction, since a lattice deformation around an R ion modifies the crystalline electric field.

Manganese has several valence states. The most common of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6 and +7. The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese (II) compounds are known. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, are restricted to the unstable oxide Mn2O7 and compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4 \u2212. Known manganese oxides include: Manganese oxide (II\u2014MnO Manganese oxide (II\u2013III)\u2014Mn3O4 Manganese oxide (III)\u2014Mn2O3 Manganese oxide (IV)\u2014MnO2 Manganese oxide (V)\u2014Mn2O5 Manganese oxide (VII)\u2014Mn2O7 Manganates are usually prepared in solution, starting from permanganate and employed in the formation of various alkaline earth compounds: 4MnO4 \u2212 +4OH\u2212 \u21d24MnO4 2\u2212 +2H2O+O2 Commercially, this ion is also prepared by dissolving MnO2 in molten KOH with air as an oxidizer: 4MnO2 +4OH\u2212 +O2 \u21d24MnO4 2\u2212 +H2O Manganic acid (VI) cannot be formed because of its rapid disproportionation.

It has nine known oxidation states: \u22121, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6 and +7. The oxidation states +7, +6, +4, and +2 are the states found most often. The most common rhenium compounds are the oxides like Re2O7, ReO3, Re2O5, ReO2, and Re2O3. Rhenium is generally available commercially as the sodium and ammonium per rhenates. It is also readily available as the di-rhenium decacarbonyl compound, Re2(CO)10.

By increasing the annealing temperature above 600\u00b0C, a decomposition process of the 2223 phase takes place.

The worsening of the superconducting properties, observed in this work by increasing the annealing time at this temperature and previously reported by other authors for similar treatments in reducing atmosphere, was found to be due to the worsening of the intergrain coupling, which results from the modification induced on the weak-link structure of the ceramics by the decomposition process.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Process", "T2": "Material", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Characterization", "T6": "Characterization", "T7": "Characterization", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Process", "T14": "Process", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Material", "T19": "SC", "T20": "Process", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Value", "T26": "Element", "T18": "Main", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T3": "Material", "T32": "Characterization", "T12": "Element", "T13": "Material", "T21": "Material", "T11": "Value", "T30": "Value", "T25": "Value"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [24, 33], "T2": [49, 57], "T4": [97, 112], "T5": [154, 159], "T6": [164, 184], "T7": [186, 189], "T8": [200, 210], "T9": [215, 223], "T10": [308, 317], "T14": [488, 509], "T15": [525, 538], "T16": [670, 678], "T17": [694, 710], "T19": [805, 820], "T20": [873, 882], "T22": [1139, 1147], "T23": [1155, 1168], "T24": [637, 642], "T26": [464, 468], "T18": [37, 48], "T27": [321, 329], "T28": [554, 564], "T29": [771, 775], "T31": [15, 23], "T3": [77, 92], "T32": [191, 195], "T12": [426, 430], "T13": [776, 782], "T21": [1040, 1050], "T11": [362, 365], "T30": [366, 371], "T25": [516, 521]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {}, "e_trig_dict": {}, "e_args_dict": {}}, {"text": "Using ALL-MBE, we have engineered a novel, artificial (metastable) cuprate superconductor, BiSr2Ca7\u2212x Dy x Cu8O19+y , in which only the central Ca layer is doped by Dy.

As is well known, the gradual removal from as-grown samples of a tiny percentage of excess oxygen ions leads to a drastic improvement of the metallic character of this system, which eventually becomes superconducting for suitable values of the cerium concentration, with a maximal critical temperature T c \u224325K. We find that the oxygen loss occurring in thermal treatments in the temperature range 500\u2013850\u00b0C leads to a reduction of the disorder hindering conductance processes, but is insufficient to make the system become superconducting. On the other hand, as soon as the annealing temperature is raised above 850\u00b0C, superconductivity appears, and at the same time a systematic variation of the length of the unit cell along the c-axis direction is detected. This is a clear indication that the transition to the superconducting phase is always accompanied by a structural modification. A further salient feature characterizing samples annealed at high temperatures is the emergence of a linear contribution in the normal-state resistivity, which superimposes to the quadratic one already present in samples which are oxygen-reduced below 850\u00b0C. This contribution is probably associated with the formation of hole-like carriers located at hole pockets developing at the Fermi energy along the nodal direction in the Brillouin zone. We conjecture that the evolution of the electronic states with oxygen removal for a given cerium concentration close to optimal doping, is similar to the one taking place in optimally annealed samples where cerium concentration is raised from the underdoped to the lightly overdoped regime value.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Process", "T2": "Material", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Property", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Main", "T13": "Property", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Element", "T16": "Property", "T17": "SC", "T18": "SC", "T19": "Property", "T20": "Process", "T21": "Process", "T22": "Material", "T23": "Property", "T24": "SC", "T25": "Process", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Material", "T29": "SC", "T31": "Process", "T32": "Process", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T35": "Process", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Property", "T39": "Property", "T40": "Property", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Property", "T45": "Process", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Property", "T11": "Value", "T53": "Value", "T54": "Value", "T30": "Material", "T10": "Process", "T12": "Element", "T7": "Doping", "T49": "Doping", "T44": "Value", "T50": "Value", "T48": "Doping", "T51": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [48, 72], "T2": [80, 90], "T3": [95, 115], "T4": [119, 128], "T5": [129, 139], "T6": [147, 155], "T8": [162, 169], "T9": [170, 189], "T13": [333, 341], "T14": [393, 408], "T15": [436, 442], "T16": [443, 456], "T17": [473, 493], "T18": [494, 497], "T19": [521, 532], "T20": [546, 564], "T21": [611, 620], "T22": [628, 636], "T23": [647, 658], "T24": [716, 731], "T25": [767, 788], "T26": [812, 829], "T27": [904, 913], "T28": [924, 930], "T29": [1008, 1023], "T31": [1131, 1139], "T32": [1143, 1160], "T33": [1210, 1222], "T34": [1223, 1234], "T35": [1313, 1327], "T36": [1404, 1408], "T37": [1434, 1438], "T38": [1465, 1477], "T39": [1511, 1525], "T40": [1567, 1577], "T41": [1590, 1596], "T42": [1617, 1623], "T43": [1624, 1637], "T45": [1711, 1719], "T46": [1734, 1740], "T47": [1741, 1754], "T11": [499, 502], "T53": [805, 810], "T54": [1334, 1339], "T30": [1057, 1080], "T10": [235, 243], "T12": [276, 294], "T7": [156, 161], "T49": [1774, 1784], "T44": [590, 593], "T50": [594, 599], "T48": [1655, 1661], "T51": [1800, 1809]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Equivalent", "R3": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["T18", "T11"], "R3": ["E1", "T8"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E4": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T7", "E3": "T49", "E2": "T48", "E4": "T51"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T6"]], "E3": [], "E2": [["Dopant", "T42"]], "E4": []}}, {"text": "We have synthesized and investigated the magnetic properties of the layered oxyselenides Sr2Co1 \u2212 x Mn x O2Cu2 \u2212 \u03b4 Se2 (0\u2a7d x \u2a7d1).

In particular, in a single level quantum dot singly occupied, the sign of the supercurrent can be reversed, giving rise to a \u03c0 -junction. This 0 \u2212 \u03c0 transition, corresponding to a singlet-doublet transition, is then driven by the gate voltage or by the superconducting phase in the case of strong competition between the superconducting proximity effect and Kondo correlations. In a two-level quantum dot, such as a clean carbon nanotube, 0\u2013 \u03c0 transitions exist as well but, because more cotunneling processes are allowed, are not necessarily associated to a magnetic state transition of the dot. In this proceeding, after a review of 0\u2013 \u03c0 transitions in Josephson junctions, we present measurements of current-phase relation in a clean carbon nanotube quantum dot, in the single and two-level regimes. In the single level regime, close to orbital degeneracy and in a regime of strong competition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity effect, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent transition is a universal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition at zero temperature.

We argue that in layered 2D cuprates the long-range order antiferromagnetism is driven mainly by the Van Hove singularity, whereas in the case of pnictides the antiferromagnetism exists as a result of the nesting condition. We show that when the interaction is quite strong ( UN F \u2248 1 ) in the case of the Van Hove singularity the electron system undergoes the antiferromagnetic phase transition with the log-range order parameter and large insulating gap. The long-range antiferromagnetism quickly disappear, as shown, with the doping away from the Van Hove singularity, but the antiferromagnetic short-range correlation persists (UNF <1) due to Coulomb repulsive interaction which is the mechanism for superconductivity in cuprates. We argue that in the case of pnictides the antiferromagnetism appears when the nesting conditions for the Fermi surface are met. Since the doping steadily changes the nesting conditions, the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity may coexist as has been observed in pnictides. We show that the proximity of the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity implies the repulsive interaction between electrons, which turns into attractive between quasiparticles as shown by the authors in the article published on the same issue as this one and entitled \u201cSuperconductivity from a Fermi Liquid: The Role of Electron-Phonon Interaction\u201d, and the superconductivity in the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid exists as a result of the repulsive interaction.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Property", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T5": "Material", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Element", "T11": "Property", "T12": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Element", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Property", "T29": "Property", "T30": "SC", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Property", "T33": "SC", "T34": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "Property", "T39": "SC", "T40": "Property", "T41": "Property", "T42": "Property", "T43": "Property", "T19": "Doping", "T27": "Doping", "T6": "Main", "T28": "Material"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [16, 29], "T2": [128, 137], "T3": [156, 161], "T4": [176, 181], "T5": [298, 305], "T7": [322, 338], "T8": [339, 357], "T9": [382, 402], "T10": [427, 436], "T11": [441, 459], "T12": [587, 607], "T13": [612, 620], "T14": [642, 659], "T15": [660, 676], "T16": [696, 711], "T17": [722, 732], "T18": [753, 771], "T20": [831, 851], "T21": [861, 878], "T22": [985, 1002], "T23": [1006, 1014], "T24": [1045, 1054], "T25": [1059, 1077], "T26": [1122, 1135], "T29": [1207, 1225], "T30": [1230, 1247], "T31": [1284, 1293], "T32": [1329, 1347], "T33": [1352, 1369], "T34": [1412, 1421], "T35": [1459, 1473], "T36": [1592, 1604], "T37": [1618, 1626], "T38": [1627, 1633], "T39": [1656, 1673], "T40": [1688, 1705], "T41": [1706, 1718], "T42": [733, 736], "T43": [928, 957], "T19": [810, 816], "T27": [1155, 1161], "T6": [309, 317], "T28": [306, 308]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T19", "E2": "T27"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": []}}, {"text": "Bulk samples of K doping K2x FeTe1-x S x with x = 0.07, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 are successfully prepared by using easy-to-use stable compound K2S as the reactant.

In the light of recent progress in experiments that have unraveled intrinsic phase diagrams in the underdoped regime, we deal with the N h dependence of the AFM moment and an in-plane superexchange J in in order to gain insight into the magnetic characteristics in antiferromagnetic high- T c superconductors.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Element", "T3": "Element", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Main", "T6": "Main", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Element", "T13": "Property", "T14": "SC", "T15": "SC", "T16": "SC", "T17": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T20": "SC", "T21": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Material", "T26": "Property", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Material", "T35": "Property", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T38": "SC", "T40": "Value", "T41": "Value", "T43": "Property", "T44": "Property", "T45": "Value", "T46": "Property", "T47": "Value", "T48": "Value", "T50": "Property", "T51": "Property", "T55": "Value", "T57": "Property", "T42": "Characterization", "T58": "Value", "T59": "Characterization", "T60": "Value", "T18": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T25": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T32": "Value", "T49": "Value", "T52": "Property", "T2": "Doping", "T31": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [12, 16], "T3": [41, 43], "T4": [55, 62], "T5": [80, 96], "T6": [98, 105], "T7": [112, 115], "T8": [156, 158], "T9": [186, 198], "T10": [199, 207], "T13": [358, 373], "T14": [420, 437], "T15": [439, 441], "T16": [500, 503], "T17": [528, 550], "T19": [570, 579], "T20": [638, 647], "T21": [648, 650], "T23": [655, 664], "T24": [678, 685], "T26": [718, 727], "T28": [829, 848], "T29": [859, 874], "T30": [969, 983], "T33": [1049, 1059], "T34": [1067, 1075], "T35": [1098, 1103], "T36": [1129, 1137], "T37": [1157, 1174], "T38": [1175, 1200], "T40": [118, 122], "T41": [127, 130], "T43": [298, 324], "T44": [326, 330], "T45": [380, 384], "T46": [552, 555], "T47": [476, 480], "T48": [489, 493], "T50": [711, 714], "T51": [878, 881], "T55": [741, 745], "T57": [447, 451], "T42": [17, 20], "T58": [67, 68], "T59": [159, 162], "T60": [254, 255], "T18": [1027, 1041], "T22": [374, 377], "T25": [483, 486], "T27": [735, 738], "T32": [692, 693], "T49": [785, 786], "T52": [825, 828], "T2": [30, 40], "T31": [991, 1001]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Equivalent", "R3": "Equivalent", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["T7", "T40"], "R3": ["T7", "T41"], "R5": ["T40", "T5"], "R6": ["T41", "T5"], "R7": ["E1", "T5"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T2", "E2": "T31"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": []}}, {"text": "LaFeAs(O,F) epitaxial thin films were grown on GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy.

The onset of superconductivity in the resistivity and ac-susceptibility measurements is suppressed with the Mg-doping. Tc (R =0) and magnitude of diamagnetism are also suppressed with the increasing Mg contents.

The CuO2/CdO2 planar oxygen modes are not significantly altered, but the apical oxygen modes around 480 and 530cm\u22121 are softened with the doping of Mg at the Ca sites. It is most likely that softening of the apical oxygen modes is induced due to better inter-plane coupling produced by Mg-doping.

The major challenge has been to determine whether these materials are fundamentally different from or essentially similar to their hole-doped counterparts; a major opportunity because answering this question would strongly constrain the possible explanations for what is the essential physics that leads to high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates, which is still not agreed upon. Here we argue that experimental results over the past 30 years on electron-doped cuprate materials have provided conclusive answers to these fundamental questions, by establishing that both in hole- and electron-doped cuprates, superconductivity originates in pairing of hole carriers in the same band. We discuss a model to describe this physics that is different from the generally accepted ones, and calculate physical observables that agree with experiment, in particular tunneling characteristics. We argue that our model is simpler, more natural and more compelling than other models.

Powder compacts of magnesium (Mg) and boron (B) were heat-treated at a temperature below or above the melt point (m. p., 649\u00b0C) of Mg for various time periods. As the reaction time increased at each reaction temperatures, the size of the powder compacts increased and the compact weight was decreased. The de-densification (so-called the pellet expansion) phenomena at the temperature above the m. p. of Mg was more remarkable. The density decrease was attributed to the three main factors of the pore formation, the out-growth of MgB2 plates and the Mg evaporation during the formation reaction of MgB2. The microstructure investigation for the initial formation stage of MgB2 at the temperature below the m. p. showed that the pores begun to form at the Mg/matrix interfaces and the spaces that the Mg powders occupied turned into open space (pores) gradually as a reaction time increased. This result indicates that the pores formation at the solid state (temperatures below the m. p.) is attributed to the large difference in diffusivity between Mg and B. In comparison to the solid state, the pore formation at the liquid state (temperatures above the m. p.) was attributed to the melting of Mg powders and the subsequent rapid movement of the melt due to the capillary force. Due to the faster mass transfer through the liquid, the pore formation at temperatures above the m. p. was much faster than that below the m. p.

This involves machining the alloy into components of various shapes, such as cylinders and rings, which are attached subsequently to the top surface of a solid, bulk HTS cylinder.

The experimental data are compared to finite element modelling of the magnetic flux distribution using Campbell\u2019s algorithm. Initially we establish the validity of the technique involving pick-up coils wrapped around the bulk superconductor to obtain its magnetic hysteresis curve in a non-destructive way and highlight the difference between the measured signal and the true magnetization of the sample. We then consider the properties of hybrid ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S) structures. Hall probe measurements, together with the results of the model, establish that flux lines curve outwards through the ferromagnet, which acts, effectively, like a magnetic short circuit. Magnetic hysteresis curves show that the effects of the superconductor and the ferromagnet simply add when the ferromagnet is saturated fully by the applied field. The trapped field of the hybrid structure is always larger than that of the superconductor alone below this saturation level, and especially when the applied field is removed.

We first check that the range of dominant superconductivity is limited to a strongly correlated regime (U>W, U: onsite correlation strength, W: band width), and coincides with the effective range of the D-H binding factors. In this range of U/t and \u03b4 (doping rate), holons (in hole-doped cases) are classified into two types: doped holons and ones created as D-H pairs.

These effects lead to features in the superconductor density of states and in the SIS tunneling conductance and provide experimental evidence of d-wave symmetry for the superconductor order parameter in the cuprates.

For various substitutes (Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Ru), we derive effective tight-binding models by constructing the maximally localized Wannier functions from the d bands around the Fermi level. The local electronic structure around the impurity site is quantitatively characterized by their onsite potential and transfer hoppings to neighboring sites. We find that the impurities are classified into three groups according to the derived parameters. For Mn, Co, and Ni, their impurity 3d levels measured from the Fe 3d level are \u223c0.3, \u22120.3, and \u22120.8 eV, respectively, while, for the Zn case, its d level is extremely deep as \u223c8 eV. For the Ru case, although the onsite-level difference is much smaller (\u223cO(0.1) eV), the transfer integrals around the impurity ion are larger than those of the pure system by 20% \u223c 30%, due to the large spatial spread of the Ru 4d orbitals. We also show that the charge distribution of the extra d electrons is confined around the impurity ion. We then unfold the first Brillouin zone (BZ) for the supercell to calculate the spectral function in the BZ for the normal cell for the case of Co and Ni doping.

All compounds crystallize in the ThCr2Si2-type structure with space group I4/mmm (No. 139): a=3.939(1)\u00c5, c=10.185(1)\u00c5, R 1=0.045, 85F2 values, 8 variable parameters for CaFe2Si2; a=4.0590(2)\u00c5, c=9.9390(8)\u00c5, R 1=0.030, 90F2 values, 10 variable parameters for CaFe0.68(6)Rh1.32(6)Si2; a=4.0695(1)\u00c5, c=9.9841(3)\u00c5, R 1=0.031, 114F2 values, 9 variable parameters for CaRh2Si2; and a=3.974(1)\u00c5, c=10.395(1)\u00c5, R 1=0.036, 95F2 values, 8 variable parameters for SrCo2Si2. The structure of SrCo2Si2 contains isolated [Co2Si2]2\u2212 2D-layers in the ab-plane whereas in CaFe2\u2212x Rh x Si2 the [T 2 Si2] layers (T=Fe and Rh) are interconnected along the c-axis via Si3Si bonds resulting in a three-dimentional (3D) [T 2Si2]2\u2212 polyanions and therefore belong to the so-called collapsed form of the ThCr2Si2-type structure. The SrCo2Si2 and CaRh2Si2 are isoelectronic to the parent 122 iron\u2013pnictide superconductors AeFe2As2 (Ae=alkaline earth elements), whereas CaFe2Si2 is a full substituted variant (As/Si) of CaFe2As2. The crystal chemistry and chemical bonding in the title compounds are discussed in terms of LMTO band structure calculations and a topological analysis using the Electron Localization Function (ELF).", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "SC", "T2": "Element", "T3": "Process", "T4": "Element", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Element", "T7": "Element", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Element", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Main", "T13": "Main", "T14": "Main", "T15": "Main", "T17": "Process", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Process", "T20": "Process", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "Material", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Characterization", "T26": "Process", "T27": "Material", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Material", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Element", "T35": "Material", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Material", "T39": "Material", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Element", "T44": "Element", "T45": "Material", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Material", "T48": "Material", "T49": "Element", "T50": "Material", "T51": "Material", "T52": "Element", "T53": "Element", "T55": "Element", "T56": "SC", "T57": "Element", "T58": "Element", "T59": "Element", "T61": "Element", "T62": "Element", "T63": "Element", "T64": "Material", "T65": "Material", "T66": "Property", "T67": "Property", "T68": "Property", "T77": "Value", "T78": "Value", "T79": "Value", "T84": "Value", "T86": "Value", "T88": "Value", "T89": "Value", "T92": "Value", "T94": "Value", "T96": "Value", "T98": "Value", "T100": "Value", "T101": "Material", "T107": "Element", "T69": "Property", "T108": "Property", "T80": "Material", "T71": "Material", "T10": "Element", "T16": "Characterization", "T54": "Property", "T60": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [15, 32], "T2": [36, 51], "T3": [109, 120], "T4": [126, 134], "T5": [135, 144], "T6": [158, 166], "T7": [170, 176], "T8": [177, 191], "T9": [192, 210], "T11": [288, 297], "T12": [298, 306], "T13": [308, 331], "T14": [333, 341], "T15": [346, 354], "T17": [414, 430], "T18": [432, 447], "T19": [473, 487], "T20": [491, 497], "T21": [498, 505], "T22": [506, 514], "T23": [569, 575], "T24": [580, 594], "T25": [595, 612], "T26": [628, 639], "T27": [647, 660], "T28": [661, 670], "T29": [676, 687], "T30": [688, 694], "T31": [783, 791], "T32": [872, 895], "T33": [976, 984], "T34": [1067, 1075], "T35": [1081, 1090], "T36": [1094, 1102], "T37": [1121, 1131], "T38": [1135, 1141], "T39": [1152, 1157], "T40": [1169, 1185], "T41": [1190, 1199], "T42": [1200, 1206], "T43": [1210, 1212], "T44": [1217, 1219], "T45": [1250, 1256], "T46": [1261, 1266], "T47": [1267, 1272], "T48": [1307, 1309], "T49": [1311, 1321], "T50": [1393, 1406], "T51": [1407, 1416], "T52": [1422, 1430], "T53": [1435, 1443], "T55": [1476, 1493], "T56": [1494, 1509], "T57": [1510, 1518], "T58": [1523, 1546], "T59": [1557, 1565], "T61": [1597, 1599], "T62": [1600, 1602], "T63": [1607, 1615], "T64": [1621, 1628], "T65": [1643, 1659], "T66": [1709, 1713], "T67": [1714, 1728], "T68": [1729, 1741], "T77": [708, 717], "T78": [721, 731], "T79": [737, 742], "T84": [795, 804], "T86": [809, 819], "T88": [825, 830], "T89": [899, 909], "T92": [913, 923], "T94": [929, 934], "T96": [992, 1001], "T98": [1005, 1015], "T100": [1021, 1026], "T101": [1132, 1134], "T107": [1520, 1522], "T69": [1779, 1809], "T108": [1811, 1814], "T80": [1288, 1305], "T71": [1322, 1332], "T10": [214, 230], "T16": [1748, 1768], "T54": [1448, 1461], "T60": [1576, 1587]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["E1", "T59"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T60"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": []}}, {"text": "The normal-state transport properties and the critical temperature, Tc , for three series of Y1 \u2212 x Ca x Ba2Cu2.8Zn0.2O y (x =0\u20130.2) samples with different oxygen content have been investigated and discussed in comparison with results for other calcium-doped YBa2Cu3O y . We have observed the calcium doping to restore the superconductivity in the YBa2Cu3O y system even in case of the preliminary Tc suppression by the direct destruction of the CuO2 planes due to a preliminary doping by zinc. The Tc value rises strongly with increasing calcium content and this rise becomes faster for the oxygen-reduced series. Based on a narrow-band model, the parameters of the band spectrum structure and the charge-carrier system in the normal state were determined from the analysis of the thermopower temperature dependences in order to reveal the mechanism of the Tc rise under the Ca influence. It is shown that the Tc increase in Y1 \u2212 x Ca x Ba2Cu2.8Zn0.2O y is related to the direct Ca ions effect.

MAX phases are a class of hexagonal-structure ternary carbides and nitrides (\u201cX\u201d) of a transition metal (\u201cM\u201d) and an A-group element. The most well known are Ti2AlC, Ti3SiC2, and Ti4AlN3. There are ~60 MAX phases with at least 9 discovered in the last five years alone. What makes the MAX phases fascinating and potentially useful is their remarkable combination of chemical, physical, electrical, and mechanical properties, which in many ways combine the characteristics of metals and ceramics. For example, MAX phases are typically resistant to oxidation and corrosion, elastically stiff, but at the same time they exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivities and are machinable. These properties stem from an inherently nanolaminated crystal structure, with M n +1X n slabs intercalated with pure A-element layers. The research on MAX phases has been accelerated by the introduction of thin-film processing methods. Magnetron sputtering and arc deposition have been employed to synthesize single-crystal material by epitaxial growth, which enables studies of fundamental material properties. However, the surface-initiated decomposition of M n +1AX n thin films into MX compounds at temperatures of 1000\u20131100\u00b0C is much lower than the decomposition temperatures typically reported for the corresponding bulk material. We also review the prospects for low-temperature synthesis, which is essential for deposition of MAX phases onto technologically important substrates. While deposition of MAX phases from the archetypical Ti\u2013Si\u2013C and Ti\u2013Al\u2013N systems typically requires synthesis temperatures of ~800\u00b0C, recent results have demonstrated that V2GeC and Cr2AlC can be deposited at ~450\u00b0C. Also, thermal spray of Ti2AlC powder has been used to produce thick coatings. We further treat progress in the use of first-principle calculations for predicting hypothetical MAX phases and their properties. Together with advances in processing and materials analysis, this progress has led to recent discoveries of numerous new MAX phases such as Ti4SiC3, Ta4AlC3, and Ti3SnC2. Finally, important future research directions are discussed. These include charting the unknown regions in phase diagrams to discover new equilibrium and metastable phases, as well as research challenges in understanding their physical properties, such as the effects of anisotropy, impurities, and vacancies on the electrical properties, and unexplored properties such as superconductivity, magnetism, and optics.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Main", "T3": "Material", "T4": "Element", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Material", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Element", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Element", "T13": "Element", "T14": "Element", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Element", "T20": "Process", "T21": "Property", "T22": "Property", "T23": "Characterization", "T24": "Material", "T26": "Material", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Material", "T29": "Process", "T30": "Process", "T33": "Material", "T34": "Material", "T35": "Material", "T36": "Property", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Material", "T39": "Element", "T40": "Property", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Process", "T44": "Process", "T45": "Material", "T46": "Process", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T49": "Element", "T50": "Element", "T51": "Process", "T52": "Process", "T53": "Element", "T54": "Material", "T55": "Material", "T56": "Process", "T58": "Property", "T59": "Element", "T60": "Material", "T61": "Element", "T62": "Element", "T63": "Element", "T64": "Element", "T65": "Property", "T66": "Material", "T67": "Property", "T68": "Material", "T69": "Material", "T70": "Property", "T71": "SC", "T72": "Property", "T74": "Value", "T75": "Value", "T77": "Element", "T78": "Value", "T79": "Value", "T80": "Value", "T81": "Element", "T5": "Material", "T87": "Material", "T86": "Element", "T88": "Element", "T92": "Element", "T32": "Material", "T101": "Property", "T57": "Element", "T105": "Material", "T25": "Doping", "T8": "Element", "T84": "Element", "T31": "Value", "T41": "Value", "T73": "Value"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [18, 26], "T2": [41, 58], "T3": [102, 111], "T4": [133, 143], "T6": [159, 178], "T7": [179, 186], "T9": [200, 208], "T10": [220, 236], "T11": [291, 297], "T12": [299, 306], "T13": [312, 319], "T14": [418, 428], "T15": [519, 529], "T16": [535, 556], "T17": [608, 614], "T18": [619, 627], "T19": [642, 652], "T20": [680, 689], "T21": [694, 703], "T22": [775, 800], "T23": [838, 842], "T24": [876, 893], "T26": [949, 955], "T27": [973, 983], "T28": [1028, 1037], "T29": [1058, 1078], "T30": [1087, 1097], "T33": [1158, 1174], "T34": [1213, 1221], "T35": [1247, 1254], "T36": [1265, 1278], "T37": [1282, 1292], "T38": [1293, 1303], "T39": [1309, 1311], "T40": [1376, 1389], "T42": [1444, 1457], "T43": [1492, 1517], "T44": [1542, 1552], "T45": [1598, 1608], "T46": [1616, 1626], "T47": [1663, 1670], "T48": [1675, 1682], "T49": [1782, 1787], "T50": [1792, 1798], "T51": [1806, 1815], "T52": [1833, 1846], "T53": [1850, 1856], "T54": [1857, 1863], "T55": [1889, 1894], "T56": [1895, 1903], "T58": [1945, 1973], "T59": [2002, 2012], "T60": [2076, 2085], "T61": [2156, 2166], "T62": [2175, 2182], "T63": [2184, 2191], "T64": [2197, 2204], "T65": [2313, 2327], "T66": [2360, 2377], "T67": [2477, 2487], "T68": [2489, 2499], "T69": [2505, 2514], "T70": [2522, 2543], "T71": [2579, 2596], "T72": [2598, 2607], "T74": [1820, 1825], "T75": [1737, 1742], "T77": [1556, 1566], "T78": [83, 84], "T79": [92, 93], "T80": [86, 87], "T81": [61, 71], "T5": [187, 195], "T87": [211, 212], "T86": [335, 345], "T88": [900, 909], "T92": [1630, 1640], "T32": [1131, 1154], "T101": [705, 722], "T57": [238, 241], "T105": [862, 875], "T25": [916, 928], "T8": [250, 265], "T84": [939, 948], "T31": [332, 334], "T41": [1341, 1345], "T73": [1346, 1352]}, "r_type_dict": {"R4": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R4": ["E1", "T88"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T25"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T84"]]}}, {"text": "Synthesis and structural details of MSr2RECu2O z (M-1212) compounds with M=Ga, Nb, Fe, Al and Co) and RE=Eu, Y are reported.

Adding fault current limiters FCLs is one of the possible solutions to mitigate negative impacts of DGs addition on protection systems. Traditional schemes have estimated the minimum value of FCL to restore relays coordination when adding DGs without resetting of any relays. That minimum value of FCL in such case is called a critical value, where below this value the relays coordination will be lost. Nowadays, designing FCL to simultaneously achieve two conflicted objectives of good performance and low cost is considered a great challenge. The paper introduces a new scheme to determine to what extent we could decrease FCL impedance value below its critical value with re-adjusting the original settings of only one adaptive relay to get relays coordination. Decreasing FCL value below its critical value will reduce the cost especially for superconductivity FCL. The proposed scheme can determine the location of that selected relay to be an adaptive one and estimate its re-adjusted new settings to be applied when DGs are added while inserting the reduced value of FCL. Actually the proposed scheme can be applied for any networks irrespective of the number of added DGs and their capacities; while having an adaptive relay is the only requirement to implement it. The proposed approach is implemented and effectively tested on the large well-known interconnected IEEE-39 bus test system with 84 relays. Its results are compared with other approaches where, no re-adjusted relays settings are applied. A noteworthy advantage of the proposed scheme is the ability to implement a reduced FCL value than the critical value, by adjusting only one relay settings in the whole network. The proposed scheme may also be extended to re-adjust settings of more than one relay and get further reduced value of FCL. Furthermore, it is also shown that a more optimum value of the total operating time of all primary relays for near end faults is achieved when applying the proposed method rather than other traditional schemes.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T3": "Material", "T4": "Material", "T6": "Material", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Material", "T10": "Property", "T11": "Property", "T12": "Material", "T13": "Property", "T14": "SC", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Material", "T2": "Doping", "T5": "Doping", "T7": "Doping", "T15": "Doping", "T16": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [72, 84], "T3": [93, 98], "T4": [144, 153], "T6": [300, 312], "T8": [413, 421], "T9": [463, 475], "T10": [716, 725], "T11": [742, 750], "T12": [838, 850], "T13": [883, 891], "T14": [934, 951], "T18": [1701, 1709], "T19": [2019, 2025], "T2": [86, 92], "T5": [190, 198], "T7": [318, 324], "T15": [1118, 1123], "T16": [1257, 1262]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T2", "E2": "T5", "E3": "T7", "E4": "T15", "E5": "T16"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": [], "E3": [], "E4": [], "E5": []}}, {"text": "Fe-doped superconductors REBa2(Cu1-x Fe x )3O7-y (RE=Y, Nd; 0\u2264x\u22640.1) were investigated by conventional and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and AC susceptibility measurements.

The rare earth containing mother compounds offer rich physics due to different antiferromagnetic orderings: the alignment of Fe magnetic moments within the FeAs sublattice, which is believed to play a role for the superconducting pairing mechanism, and the ordering of the rare-earth magnetic moments at low temperatures. Here, we present thin film preparation and a film growth study of SmFeAsO on MgO(100) substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In general, the PLD method is capable to produce iron oxyarsenide thin films, however, competition with impurity phase formation narrows the parameter window. We assume that the film growth in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment results in an oxygen-deficient phase, SmFeAsO1\u2212\u03b4 . Despite the large lattice misfit, we find epitaxial oxyarsenide thin film growth on MgO(100) with evolving film thickness. Bragg reflections are absent in very thin films although they locally show indications for pseudomorphic growth of the first unit cells. We propose the possibility for a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode as a result of the large in-plane lattice misfit between the iron oxypnictide and the MgO unit cells. A columnar 3-dimensional film growth mode dominates and the surface roughness is determined by growth mounds, a non-negligible parameter for device fabrication as well as in the application of surface sensitive probes. Furthermore, we found evidence for a stratified growth in steps of half a unit cell, i.e. alternating growth of (FeAs)\u2212 and (SmO1\u2212\u03b4 )+ layers, the basic structural components of the unit cell.

By using N G, thermodynamic critical field, B c(0), the lower critical field, B c1(0), and critical current density, J c(0), are extracted. It was found from these analyses that widths of critical and 3D regimes are shrunken with the increased doping of Cd in the final compound. Also \u03be c(0), V F and the coupling constant J are suppressed with increased Cd doping. The decrease in important superconductivity parameters is suggested to be arising due to anharmonic oscillations induced by the heavier Cd atoms doped at Cu planar sites which in turn suppress the density of the desired phonons required for optimum superconducting properties. In these analyses we found that the critical magnetic fields (B c(0), B c1(0)) and J c(0) increase with increased Cd concentration.

Inclusion of CNTs to the YBCO enhances the value of critical current density and gives maximum value of J C which is 12 times more than that of pure YBCO sample for 0.8 wt% of YBCO.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "SC", "T3": "SC", "T4": "SC", "T5": "Main", "T6": "Main", "T8": "Element", "T9": "Process", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Material", "T12": "Material", "T13": "Characterization", "T14": "Characterization", "T15": "Characterization", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Element", "T20": "SC", "T21": "Material", "T22": "Element", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Element", "T27": "Property", "T29": "SC", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Process", "T35": "Property", "T36": "SC", "T40": "Material", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Material", "T44": "Material", "T45": "Element", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Property", "T48": "Property", "T49": "Element", "T50": "Element", "T51": "Value", "T23": "Characterization", "T52": "Characterization", "T53": "Value", "T1": "Material", "T41": "Property", "T54": "Value", "T55": "Value", "T56": "Value", "T57": "Value", "T58": "Value", "T59": "Property", "T37": "SC", "T7": "Doping", "T26": "Doping", "T32": "Doping", "T38": "Doping", "T39": "Doping", "T60": "Doping", "T28": "Characterization", "T61": "Property"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [56, 71], "T3": [86, 117], "T4": [119, 123], "T5": [125, 136], "T6": [138, 142], "T8": [176, 180], "T9": [241, 261], "T10": [273, 285], "T11": [286, 295], "T12": [326, 337], "T13": [361, 378], "T14": [380, 383], "T15": [402, 422], "T16": [468, 486], "T17": [494, 506], "T18": [507, 516], "T19": [520, 524], "T20": [525, 540], "T21": [541, 547], "T22": [571, 575], "T24": [680, 686], "T25": [690, 694], "T27": [719, 740], "T29": [824, 839], "T30": [840, 844], "T31": [849, 853], "T33": [874, 878], "T34": [892, 908], "T35": [909, 920], "T36": [954, 974], "T40": [1068, 1076], "T42": [1149, 1153], "T43": [1162, 1172], "T44": [1222, 1232], "T45": [1247, 1251], "T46": [1259, 1263], "T47": [1286, 1310], "T48": [1338, 1341], "T49": [1383, 1387], "T50": [1410, 1414], "T51": [182, 185], "T23": [581, 624], "T52": [626, 631], "T53": [1399, 1406], "T1": [14, 38], "T41": [1122, 1127], "T54": [187, 190], "T55": [192, 195], "T56": [197, 200], "T57": [202, 205], "T58": [208, 215], "T59": [1128, 1138], "T37": [977, 983], "T7": [147, 155], "T26": [695, 700], "T32": [862, 870], "T38": [996, 1001], "T39": [1039, 1044], "T60": [1234, 1243], "T28": [753, 764], "T61": [741, 752]}, "r_type_dict": {"R4": "Target", "R5": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R4": ["E1", "T5"], "R5": ["E6", "T46"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T7", "E2": "T26", "E3": "T32", "E4": "T38", "E5": "T39", "E6": "T60"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T8"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T25"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T33"]], "E4": [], "E5": [], "E6": [["Dopant", "T45"]]}}, {"text": "We performed 63,65Cu and 139La NMR measurements of T\u2019-La1.8Eu0.2CuO 4 + \u03b4 (T\u2019-LECO) with the Nd2CuO4-type structure (so-called T\u2019-structure). As a result, we detected the 63,65Cu NMR signal under finite magnetic fields and found superconductivity without antiferromagnetic (AF) order only in the reduced T\u2019-LECO, where excess apical oxygen atoms are properly removed. This indicates that the intrinsic ground state of the ideal T\u2019-LECO is a paramagnetic and superconducting (SC) state. Below T c, the Knight shift was found to rapidly decrease, which indicates the emergence of bulk superconductivity due to spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the reduced T\u2019-LECO. In the SC state of the reduced T\u2019-LECO, moreover, a characteristic temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1 was observed, which implies the existence of nodal lines in the SC gap. These findings suggest that the superconductivity in the reduced T\u2019-LECO probably has d-wave symmetry. In the normal state of the reduced T\u2019-LECO, on the other hand, AF fluctuations were found to exist from the temperature dependence of 1/T 1 T, though no clear pseudogap behavior was observed.

To study of magnetoresistance is one of the most important ways to investigate the intergranular nature of superconducting materials. The resistive transition is made of two parts. The first- unaffected to applied magnetic field part which is near the onset of superconductivity. This region is due to superconductivity in grains. The second- broaden tail part which is due to the connectivity of the grains. At temperatures close to T c 0, (\u03c1 = 0), under applied magnetic fields, weak links are affected and the vortices are penetrated and move inside the intergranular and then the tail part is broaden. This broadening part observed in the electrical resistivity, \u03c1(T), and in the derivative of the electrical resistivity, d\u03c1/dT, becomes too small or even absent in Ni doped samples.

To clarify the physical origin of this spectral weight transfer we consider several microscopic hamiltonians that give rise to an effective hamiltonian with a kinetic pairing interaction. These models describe small polarons with a non-linear interaction with a background degree of freedom, that gives rise to an effective mass enhancement that depends on the local charge occupation.

In this paper, we will review several processes for increasing growth rate and achieving higher T c REBCO superconductors. There are two effective methods to enhance the growth rate. One is to grow single crystals under high oxygen partial pressure, the other is to partially or completely replace Y by RE elements with higher solubilities in the Ba-Cu-O solution, for instance RE = Nd, Sm. Using these methods the growth rate was increased. The unprecendently large REBCO single crystals with the size 25 \u00d7 25 mm2 on the a-b plane and up to 20 mm in thickness were obtained. Regarding superconductivity, the critical temperature T c of about 93 K was achieved from the Y123 single crystals both grown under air and 1 atm oxygen pressure, indicating that T c is insensitive to the growth atmosphere of the oxygen pressure in the YBCO system. Furthermore, the high T c of about 95 K NdBCO superconductors with a sharp transition was obtained by using Ba-rich liquid (Ba:Cu ratio = 0.75\u20130.80 of solvent), suggesting that the liquid composition is an important thermodynamic parameter for controlling T c. Moreover, the partial substitution RE (RE = Nd, Sm) at the Y sites up to 30% shows no obvious reduction of T c remaining at about 91\u00b11 K.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "SC", "T2": "Material", "T4": "SC", "T5": "SC", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Process", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Material", "T10": "SC", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Material", "T14": "Process", "T15": "SC", "T16": "Process", "T18": "SC", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Property", "T22": "SC", "T24": "SC", "T25": "Main", "T27": "Value", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Element", "T3": "Element", "T33": "Material", "T34": "Element", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T38": "Value", "T39": "Value", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Value", "T44": "Element", "T45": "Element", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Element", "T48": "Element", "T49": "Value", "T50": "Element", "T51": "Value", "T52": "Element", "T53": "Element", "T54": "Value", "T55": "Element", "T57": "Main", "T58": "Main", "T62": "Element", "T64": "Material", "T65": "Process", "T66": "Process", "T68": "Process", "T69": "Process", "T70": "Process", "T11": "SC", "T71": "Process", "T72": "Process", "T23": "Doping", "T26": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T30": "Value", "T56": "Value", "T29": "Doping", "T17": "SC", "T59": "Process"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [53, 68], "T2": [138, 152], "T4": [257, 260], "T5": [267, 282], "T6": [359, 374], "T7": [393, 409], "T8": [634, 649], "T9": [687, 692], "T10": [747, 764], "T12": [791, 794], "T13": [836, 851], "T14": [890, 898], "T15": [916, 919], "T16": [974, 982], "T18": [1049, 1064], "T19": [1119, 1125], "T20": [1184, 1190], "T21": [1219, 1242], "T22": [1259, 1262], "T24": [1371, 1374], "T25": [107, 120], "T27": [1038, 1042], "T31": [261, 266], "T32": [459, 460], "T3": [508, 515], "T33": [516, 524], "T34": [539, 541], "T35": [544, 546], "T36": [548, 550], "T37": [464, 466], "T38": [703, 708], "T39": [664, 675], "T40": [628, 633], "T41": [990, 994], "T42": [831, 835], "T43": [1394, 1400], "T44": [1299, 1301], "T45": [1303, 1305], "T46": [1308, 1310], "T47": [1312, 1314], "T48": [1043, 1048], "T49": [804, 808], "T50": [1111, 1113], "T51": [877, 882], "T52": [883, 889], "T53": [967, 973], "T54": [1337, 1340], "T55": [1323, 1324], "T57": [122, 127], "T58": [131, 136], "T62": [386, 392], "T64": [712, 721], "T65": [37, 43], "T66": [153, 159], "T68": [331, 342], "T69": [354, 358], "T70": [576, 587], "T11": [770, 790], "T71": [857, 862], "T72": [942, 959], "T23": [451, 458], "T26": [1127, 1129], "T28": [1130, 1132], "T30": [1141, 1145], "T56": [1146, 1150], "T29": [1286, 1298], "T17": [1020, 1028], "T59": [224, 235]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target", "R2": "Equivalent", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Equivalent", "R8": "Condition", "R9": "Equivalent", "R10": "Condition", "R11": "Condition"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["T27", "T48"], "R2": ["T12", "T49"], "R3": ["T49", "T42"], "R4": ["T24", "T43"], "R8": ["T43", "E2"], "R9": ["T17", "T27"], "R10": ["T43", "E3"], "R11": ["T43", "E4"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T23", "E2": "T29", "E3": "T29", "E4": "T29"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Site", "T32"], ["Dopant", "T37"]], "E2": [["Site", "T55"], ["Dopant", "T46"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T47"], ["Site", "T55"]], "E4": [["Dopant", "T44"], ["Site", "T55"]]}}, {"text": "Heavy alkali metal-arsenic alloys intercalate easily into graphite, leading to the formation of a new family of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs).

Removing the topmost surface by cleavage in vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere prior to tunneling measurements has been demonstrated to be indispensable to observe intrinsic superconducting gap structure in Bi2212. The reported superconducting gap spectra have been analyzed in the framework of d-wave superconductivity. It has been found that results can be, in principle, described in terms of the d-wave order parameter. (3) Hole doping and temperature dependence have been further investigated. Gap-like structures have been reported for underdoped Bi2212 samples above T c. These gap-like structures should be understood in accordance with the \u201cpseudogap\u201d observed in other types of measurements.

The inner vortex excitation spectra are found to be quite different from those expected from a simple d-wave mechanism. (5) Phase-sensitive measurements have been carried out for Y123 crystals with different orientations. Josephson tunneling at the interface between conventional and high-temperature superconductors has also been investigated.

There is an intrinsic misfit between the size of the LaO9 polyhedra and the CuO6 octahedra, which seems to cause the structural transition from the high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase. Within this misfit model it is possible to explain almost the entire phenomenology of the HTT-LTO transition. The electronic structure is related to this phase transition via the length of the Cu\ue5f8O bonds. One of the effects of the transition on the structure is to lengthen these Cu\ue5f8O bonds and hence to alter the electronic band structure. The introduction of additional charge by doping leads to a decrease of the equilibrium Cu\ue5f8O distances, and hence to a reduction of the misfit. In this way the charge-carrier concentration determines the structural transition. We always observe strongly anisotropic thermal parameters, which confirm the instability of the La2\u2212x Sr x CuO4 structure against a rotation of the CuO6 octahedra around any axis.

In this work, the effects of load cycles on the contact mechanical characteristics among strands in the cable cross section are studied in detail. The distribution characteristics of contact forces among strands are analyzed firstly. It can be found that the probability density of the normal and tangential contact forces all decay with an exponential law and they are unaffected by cycle numbers. Sequentially, the distribution and evolution features of the transverse compressive stresses of strands associated with cycle numbers are investigated. The numerical results show that the peak of the occurrence probability distribution decreases and the range of high stress becomes broader with increasing cycle numbers. In addition, the variation of each strand\u2019s adjacent number with respect to cycle loads and its effect on the stress distribution are also presented.

This review has tried to show some of these aspects: (A) There is a wealth of data showing the existence of important lattice effects and intrinsic inhomogeneities in 123-O x . (1) Five phase transitions exist: - The well-known T\u2014O transition at x = 6.4, which according to Kartha et al. (1995) and Krumhansl (1992) is a first-order martensitic transformation. Also a neutron diffraction refinement (Radaelli et al. 1992) concludes that it is a first-order structural transition (sect. 3.2.1). The onset of superconductivity (I\u2014M transition) takes place inside the composition range of the T\u2014O transition (fig. 25d,e) and the latter triggers the former, as originally proposed by Cava et al. (1990). The ideas of a universal hole count for all cuprates to become superconducting (Tallon et al.) are doubtful for 123-O x because their proof was based on questionable samples (sect. 5.3, 8.4). Recent structural data on very slowly cooled equilibrium samples (Conder et al. 1999; sect. 3.2.2) support clearly the abrupt change of the c-axis and apical bond found earlier by Cava et al. (1990). Charge transfer from the chains to the planes is coupled to this c-axis contraction. A giant dT c/dP effect is measured at this composition which seems to be correlated with the oxygen ordering taking place at this transition (sect. 5.4). Raman investigations show another transition or cross-over at the N\u00e9el temperature (x = 6.22). Deconvolution of the apex-phonon width shows the coexistence of four phases in the nonstoichiometric range of 123. It is possible that physical phase separation starts at x = 6.22 with the formation of hole-doped islands in an AF matrix (sect. 3.3.2), the percolation to the superconducting phase taking place at x \u2248 6.40. - A fourth latent transition or cross-over takes place at x = 6.75. At this composition the a- and b-lattice parameters deviate from linearity, and orthorhombicity, mimicking T c, starts saturating (figs. 25a\u2013c). It is possible, therefore, that this composition marks the start of the negative interactions leading to a decreasing T c in the overdoped phase. Structurally, these changes are mainly in the planes, but have appreciable influence on the apex phonon frequency which for x > 6.75 becomes independent of doping (although its bond length is further decreasing). The most pronounced physical effect is the giant dT c/dP increase (sect. 5.4), which is also connected with thermal expansion anomalies of the a-axis near T c (sect. 5.4.2). - A fifth transition exists at the onset of the overdoped phase, x = 6.95. This is a displacive transformation (Kaldis et al. 1997b) followed by a decrease of orthorhombicity and a stepwise decrease of the b-axis (fig. 25b), but most importantly by an abrupt increase of dimpling (sect. 6). This transition is the boundary of the phase-separated overdoped phase. This is supported by the splitting of the diamagnetic transition to T c2, onset (almost independent of oxygen doping) and T c1, and also by Raman measurements. The physical phase separation is probably due to overdoped islands in a matrix of the optimally doped phase. Thus, both ends of the superconducting field seem to be phase-separated (6.15 <x < 6.40, and 6.95 <x < 7.00). The T c2, onset appears with the same value in the Ca-doped 123 (see below). The transitions at x = 6.75 and 6.95 lead to changes parallel to the c-axis, but are induced by changes of orthorhombicity. The latter is triggered by displacement of O2,O3 parallel to the c-axis and away from Cu2 (which moves out of the planes). (2) Several lattice distortions have been found in the underdoped and optimally doped fields. - PDF (sect. 4.2) shows that in the local structure, shifts of 0.1 of the oxygen sites appear along the c-axis in domains of \u223c10 . The question arises whether this is the result of the presence of polarons or some kind of stripes, as was shown to be the case for the La cuprates. - Electron diffraction shows correlated displacements of Cu2 and O1 in the a\u2013b plane (sect. 4.3), leading to local perturbation of charge density roughly parallel to the c-axis, supporting the results of PDF. These perturbations form a network of cells in the a\u2013b plane with nanoscopic dimensions, comparable with the coherence length. The reason for these distortions is the strain field, which has been shown to exist also with the bond valence sum method in the 123-perovskite lattice (sect. 3.2.1.4). These results support the nanoscale phase separation model of Phillips and Jung (2001a,b) (sect. 4.3.1). - Y-EXAFS shows displacements of the O2,03 and Cu2 atoms parallel to the c-axis, inducing distortions of the dimpling. Lattice distortions appear also both at T c and the spin-gap opening temperature. (B) A large number of experiments support the existence of several fields of phase separation. We have mentioned under (1) and (2) the physical phase separation at the two boundaries of the superconducting regime. In the underdoped range a kind of phase-rule obeying phase separation in mesoscopic scale can be considered, due to the existence of a series of in-phase phonon-frequency steps (\u201cphases\u201d), appearing at compositions where also the chain superstructures appear. This puts the question about the existence of dimpling-chain superstructures, where the chain-ordering phenomena would be correlated with the dimpling Raman shifts parallel to the c-axis (sect. 5.5.2). (figs. 110, 111). (C) A bag full of interesting and unexpected complexities is the case of Ca-doped 123-O x . The structural data and the T c change give the impression of classical overdoping: c-axis and apical bond increasing, T c decreasing with Ca doping. A thorough inspection of the magnetization data of fully oxygenated samples shows that there also is a strong diamagnetic splitting and, therefore, phase separation following the pattern of the O-overdoped 123, and supported by the appearance of new Raman modes (sect. 8.2). T c2, onset has the same value as for optimally O-doped 123O6.92 and is almost independent of Ca doping, T c1 decreases strongly with Ca doping. The question about the local structure opens Pandora's box. Y-EXAFS sees, up to R eff \u2248 5 \u00c5, almost no changes in the spectra and at higher Ca doping something like amorphisation. A model accommodating these difficulties (sect. 8.4) is the monodisperse dissolution of Ca-123 molecules in the lattice (R\u00f6hler et al. 1999b). This is expected to lead to localization of the holes introduced by Ca, the carriers screened by the locally distorted Y-123 cells surrounding the Ca-123. Then, the overdoping does not come from the holes doped by Ca but by the decreasing Y-123 contributions to the superconducting carriers with increasing Ca content. Not only may all of these be wrong in our picture of Ca-123. The assumption of linear dependence of O content on Ca% is also wrong (sect. 8.1). Up to 17% Ca very little oxygen is lost, not supporting the classical picture of substitution, except if the Ca holes are not available to the lattice. And last but not least, Ca-123O6 which has been used to support the adoption of the parabolic dependence of T c on the carrier concentration for 123 (Tallon et al. 1995) is not superconducting! 123O6 doped with 5 different Ca compositions (0\u201322%) was found not to be superconducting (fig. 51) as discussed in sect. 8.4 (Merz et al. 1998). Summing up we can say that from the structural point of view the lattice strains are very important, leading to most of the local structure effects. The above is a list of experimental facts, which depending on the theoretical model can be interpreted differently. The ultimate goal of this review is to bring these facts to the attention of the reader (or remind some of them). Because whatever their interpretation may be, these experimental facts should not be overlooked.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "Material", "T3": "Property", "T4": "Characterization", "T6":

This investigation confirmed that all systems under consideration fall within the critical range and that damping of TAO would be needed to achieve stable operation conditions. The geometry and hence the temperature distribution within the cryogenic system of the accelerator facility could not be altered arbitrarily. Possible TAO damping techniques were narrowed to two options: (a) adding restrictions at the cold end and (b) control of the helium gas pressure. In all systems, before modifications, pressure oscillations were clearly observed within the frequency range 0.25\u201347Hz.

At selected sample temperatures, irradiations continued until a critical fluence, D c, was reached where the original structure disappeared. The temperature dependence of D c shows a minimum near the superconducting transition temperature, T c, and is correlated with the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, which has a maximum near T c. At an irradiation temperature near this maximum in thermal conductivity, a minimum amount of damage recovery occurs because heat can be dissipated away from the displacement cascade. Ion irradiation suppresses the T c. The rate of decrease in the T c as a function of damage (measured in displacements per atom, dpa) was found to be the same for various incident ions (He+, O2+, Au5+ which shows that the damage accumulation is a result of atomic collisions. Further, the rate of decrease in T c was found to be the same for both transport and magnetization measurements, indicating that the displacements effect the bulk of the samples through point defect creation.

The AC susceptibility and resistivity measurements showed that the superconducting transition temperature, T c, is suppressed (about 6 K) with the addition of Ca into the main compound. The hysteresis loops of YCa-358 show peak like projecting parts at temperatures below 45 K and around zero applied field that may be due to the local modulation of the composition in YCa-358.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy investigation on the interface structure indicates that FeSe films grow epitaxially on MgO(001) and that overlayer Fe atoms diffuse into the top two layers of MgO and substitute Mg atoms. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that this substitution promotes the charge transfer from the MgO substrate to the FeSe films, an essential process that also occurs in monolayer FeSe on TiO2-terminated oxides and contributes to the enhanced superconductivity therein.

The weak van der Waals interlayer bonding between hexagonal layers of octahedral or trigonal prismatic TMD building blocks allows many polytypes to form. In the single layer 1 T polytype materials, one or more CDW states can form, but the pristine TMDs are not superconducting. The 2 H polytypes have two or more Fermi surfaces and saddle bands, allowing for dual orderings, which can be coexisting CDW and SC orderings, two SC gaps as in MgB2, two CDW gaps, and possibly even pseudogaps above the onset T CDW s of CDW orderings. Higher order polytypes allow for multiple CDW gaps and at least one superconducting gap. The CDW transitions T CDW s usually greatly exceed the superconducting transitions at their low T c values, their orbital order parameters (OPs) are generally highly anisotropic and can even contain nodes, and the SC OPs can be greatly affected by their simultaneous presence. The properties of the CDWs ubiquitously seen in TMDs are remarkably similar to those of the pseudogaps seen in the high- T c cuprates. In 2H-NbSe2, for example, the CDW renders its general s-wave SC OP orbital symmetry to be highly anisotropic and strongly reduces its Josephson coupling strength ( I c R n ) with the conventional SC, Pb. Hence, the pristine TMDs are highly \u201cunconventional\u201d in comparison with Pb, but are much more \u201cconventional\u201d than are the ferromagnetic superconductors such as URhGe. Applied pressure and intercalation generally suppress the TMD CDWs, allowing for enhanced SC formation, even in the 1 T polytype materials. The misfit intercalation compound (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2) and many 2 H -TMDs intercalated with organic Lewis base molecules, such as TaS2(pyridine)1/2, have completely incoherent c-axis transport, dimensional-crossover effects, and behave as stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions. Except for the anomalously large apparent violation of the Pauli limit of the upper critical field of (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2), these normal state and superconducting properties of these intercalation compounds are very similar to those seen in the high- T c superconductor, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 and in the organic layered superconductor, \u03ba-(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br, where ET is bis(ethylenedithio) tetrathiafulvalene.

No trace of superconductivity is observed down to 2K for this sample and the variation of resistivity with temperature shows a semiconducting behaviour. As Eu is added and for x \u22650.2, the samples convert totally to B or Raveau phase and become superconducting. The highest T c, obtained from both magnetic and resistivity measurements, is observed for x =0.3. In the normal state, all the samples exhibit a semiconducting character which decreases as well as resistivity when the Eu content increases. The refinement of cell parameters is done with considering the structural modulation. The study shows that the substitution of Sr2+ by Eu3+ leads to an increase of a and b parameters, while c decreases similarly to those of the La doped phases. The a axis component of the modulation is observed to be independent of Eu content, while the c axis one increases slightly as this content increases. The XRD analysis has also revealed that the limit solubility of the used Eu2O3 oxide is situated between x =0.3 and 0.4 of Eu content.

Superconducting microscopic parameters such as coherence length {\u03bec(0)}, inter-layer coupling (J), Fermi velocity (VF) and Fermi energy (EF) of the carriers were determined as a function of Cr content in (Cr)x/CuTl-1223 nano-superconductor composites by excess conductivity analyses in three dimensional (3D), two dimensional (2D) and short wave dimensional (0D) fluctuation regions.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Property", "T2": "Element", "T3": "Element", "T4": "Material", "T6": "Element", "T7": "SC", "T8": "Material", "T10": "Main", "T12": "Material", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Material", "T18": "Element", "T19": "Material", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Element", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Material", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Material", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T31": "Material", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Material", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Material", "T39": "Material", "T40": "Process", "T41": "Property", "T42": "SC", "T43": "Element", "T44": "Material", "T45": "Material", "T46": "SC", "T47": "Property", "T49": "Property", "T50": "Property", "T51": "Element", "T53": "Element", "T54": "SC", "T55": "Material", "T56": "Property", "T57": "Material", "T58": "Material", "T59": "Material", "T61": "Value", "T62": "Value", "T63": "Value", "T64": "Value", "T65": "Property", "T66": "Property", "T48": "Material", "T68": "Material", "T69": "Material", "T70": "Material", "T71": "Material", "T72": "Property", "T73": "Material", "T75": "Element", "T11": "SC", "T13": "Material", "T77": "Property", "T38": "Property", "T5": "Doping", "T9": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [0, 18], "T2": [19, 27], "T3": [29, 31], "T4": [33, 46], "T6": [61, 85], "T7": [98, 113], "T8": [114, 120], "T10": [135, 150], "T12": [204, 214], "T14": [318, 333], "T15": [334, 354], "T16": [364, 374], "T18": [413, 415], "T19": [416, 429], "T20": [450, 467], "T21": [480, 489], "T22": [490, 505], "T23": [506, 512], "T24": [552, 565], "T25": [573, 589], "T26": [606, 621], "T27": [622, 642], "T28": [680, 696], "T29": [704, 717], "T30": [739, 744], "T31": [752, 759], "T32": [769, 787], "T33": [788, 790], "T34": [791, 804], "T35": [814, 820], "T36": [851, 856], "T37": [857, 871], "T39": [881, 894], "T40": [910, 919], "T41": [927, 938], "T42": [1001, 1016], "T43": [1056, 1058], "T44": [1059, 1072], "T45": [1080, 1090], "T46": [1092, 1107], "T47": [1139, 1155], "T49": [1191, 1205], "T50": [1215, 1227], "T51": [1282, 1284], "T53": [1296, 1311], "T54": [1317, 1331], "T55": [1332, 1342], "T56": [1353, 1365], "T57": [1378, 1395], "T58": [1397, 1399], "T59": [1402, 1417], "T61": [156, 157], "T62": [159, 162], "T63": [164, 168], "T64": [174, 182], "T65": [1207, 1209], "T66": [1229, 1231], "T48": [1165, 1185], "T68": [1187, 1188], "T69": [1419, 1421], "T70": [1427, 1449], "T71": [1451, 1453], "T72": [1157, 1162], "T73": [285, 298], "T75": [87, 96], "T11": [184, 203], "T13": [273, 283], "T77": [1240, 1248], "T38": [1017, 1032], "T5": [52, 57], "T9": [401, 409]}, "r_type_dict": {"R7": "Target", "R8": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R7": ["E1", "T6"], "R8": ["E2", "T21"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T5", "E2": "T9"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T2"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T18"]]}}, {"text": "(Ba,K)Fe2As2 superconducting wires have been fabricated by ex-situ powder-in-tube method.

The hole densities at Cu and oxygen sites in the CuO2 plane have been extracted from the nuclear quadrupole frequency \u03bd Q . The striking feature is that the Cu holes are significantly transferred to oxygen site due to strong hybridization between Cu and oxygen. From an analysis of T 1 and T 2G , it has been found that the spectral weight of the spin fluctuation is transferred to higher energy compared to YBa2Cu3O7, while the magnetic correlation length \u03be does not differ much. Thus, it is suggested that the higher T c is due to higher characteristic energy of spin fluctuations, i.e. the superconductivity is spin fluctuation mediated. The superconducting properties are consistently explained by a d-wave superconductivity model with a finite density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. We show that the disorder of the Ca/TlO layer caused by the partial inter-substitution of Tl and Ca is responsible for the potential scattering to produce such a DOS.

In the superconducting state, coherent Bogoliubov quasiparticles develop preferentially over the nodal region in the underdoped regime. We can then define the fraction of coherent Fermi surface, f c around the nodes for which quasiparticles are well defined and superconductivity sets in. We find that f c is doping dependent and leads to the emergence of two energy scales. We then establish in a single gap scenario, that the critical temperature T c is proportional to f c \u0394 max where \u0394 max is the maximum amplitude of the d-wave superconducting gap. In the normal state, the loss of antinodal quasiparticles spectral weight detected in the superconducting state persists and the spectral weight is only restored above the pseudogap temperature T \u204e . Such a dichotomy in the quasiparticles dynamics of underdoped cuprates is responsible for the emergence of the two energy scales in the superconducting state and the appearance of the pseudogap in the normal state. We propose a 3D phase diagram where both the temperature and the energy phase diagrams have been plotted together. This 3D diagram advocates in favor of a low temperature phase transition inside the superconducting dome.

Materials of type Bi2.1-xTmxSr2.0Ca1.1Cu2.0Oy with molar ratio changes of 0.00 \u2264 x \u2264 0.30 are prepared by conventional solid-state reaction route in atmospheric pressure and the characterizations are exerted by the bulk density, dc electrical resistivity (\u03c1-T), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), critical current density (J c ), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron dispersive X-ray (EDX) experimental measurements. The combination of experimental results evaluated from the bulk density, dc electrical resistivity, XRD and EDX measurements points out that the Tm foreign impurities mostly incorporate successfully into the Bi-2212 crystal lattice. In fact, the EDX investigations verify that the thulium impurities may mostly be substituted for the bismuth sites in the crystal structure. All the experimental results declare that the characteristic features improve regularly with the increment in the Tm impurity level up to x = 0.07 beyond which the properties degrade dramatically. In this respect, the sample with x = 0.07 exhibits highest electrical conductive/metallic characteristics as a consequence of the refinement in the crystal structure quality and connectivity between the superconducting grains, being favored by bulk density and related relative degrees of granularity surveys. Likewise, the material presents the maximum offset-onset critical transition temperature values of 85.61 K\u201385.85 K due to the increment in the formation of effective and strong electron-phonon coupling probabilities and optimization of mobile hole carrier concentrations in the Cu-O2 consecutively stacked layers. In other words, the optimum content level leading to transit inherently over-doped nature into optimally doped state strengthens the amplitude of pair wave function for the Bi-2212 material. In more sophisticated interpretations, the presence of optimum dopant in the crystal structure changes the vibrational mode intensities of O (1)CuA1g, B1g phonons and O (2)SrA1g phonon so that the formation possibility of bipolaron out of two polarons increases strongly in a polarizable lattice (polaronic effect). Additionally, the highest self-field J c of 95 A/cm2 confirms the fact that the optimum dopant augments the effective nucleation centers along the intragrain and inter-grain boundaries in the crystal system. Similarly, the material prepared with x = 0.07 presents the smoothest, densest, largest average crystalline distribution, lowest porosity and most uniform surface appearance with the finest connection between the superconducting grains. The XRD results (the increased high phase, c-axis length and average grain size but decreased a-axis length) also show the optimum dopant level of x = 0.07 for Bi-2212 crystal system. All in all, the paper developing a strong methodology about why the characteristic properties improve with the presence of Tm impurity in the Bi-2212 system may be a pioneering research to construct

Doping solid aromatic hydrocarbons with metals provides the superconductivity. The first discovery of such superconductivity was made for K-doped picene (K x picene, five benzene rings). Its superconducting transition temperatures (T c\u2019s) were 7 and 18K. Recently, we found a new superconducting K x picene phase with a T c as high as 14K, so we now know that K x picene possesses multiple superconducting phases. Besides K x picene, we discovered new superconductors such as Rb x picene and Ca x picene. A most serious problem is that the shielding fraction is \u2a7d15% for K x picene and Rb x picene, and it is often \u223c1% for other superconductors. Such low shielding fractions have made it difficult to determine the crystal structures of superconducting phases. Nevertheless, many research groups have expended a great deal of effort to make high quality hydrocarbon superconductors in the five years since the discovery of hydrocarbon superconductivity. At the present stage, superconductivity is observed in certain metal-doped aromatic hydrocarbons (picene, phenanthrene and dibenzopentacene), but the shielding fraction remains stubbornly low. The highest priority research area is to prepare aromatic superconductors with a high superconducting volume-fraction. Despite these difficulties, aromatic superconductivity is still a core research target and presents interesting and potentially breakthrough challenges, such as the positive pressure dependence of T c that is clearly observed in some phases of aromatic hydrocarbon superconductors, suggesting behavior not explained by the standard BCS picture of superconductivity. In this article, we describe the present status of this research field, and discuss its future prospects.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T4": "Material", "T6": "Material", "T7": "SC", "T8": "SC", "T10": "Element", "T11": "SC", "T12": "SC", "T13": "Element", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Element", "T16": "SC", "T17": "Element", "T18": "SC", "T19": "Element", "T20": "Element", "T21": "Element", "T22": "Element", "T23": "SC", "T24": "Material", "T25": "SC", "T26": "SC", "T27": "Element", "T28": "SC", "T29": "SC", "T30": "Material", "T32": "Element", "T33": "Element", "T34": "SC", "T35": "SC", "T36": "SC", "T37": "Process", "T38": "SC", "T39": "Element", "T40": "SC", "T41": "Property", "T42": "SC", "T44": "Element", "T9": "Element", "T48": "Value", "T49": "Value", "T50": "Value", "T51": "Element", "T53": "Element", "T54": "Property", "T55": "Property", "T56": "Property", "T57": "Main", "T58": "Material", "T43": "Element", "T45": "Element", "T59": "Property", "T60": "Property", "T52": "Element", "T61": "Property", "T69": "Property", "T2": "Property", "T3": "Doping", "T5": "Doping", "T31": "Doping", "T46": "SC", "T47": "Value", "T62": "Value"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [34, 41], "T4": [132, 137], "T6": [165, 171], "T7": [185, 202], "T8": [232, 249], "T10": [279, 289], "T11": [316, 355], "T12": [405, 420], "T13": [421, 431], "T14": [445, 448], "T15": [485, 495], "T16": [515, 530], "T17": [547, 557], "T18": [577, 592], "T19": [601, 612], "T20": [617, 628], "T21": [696, 706], "T22": [711, 722], "T23": [754, 769], "T24": [840, 858], "T25": [862, 877], "T26": [991, 1006], "T27": [1048, 1059], "T28": [1060, 1077], "T29": [1101, 1118], "T30": [1142, 1147], "T32": [1185, 1197], "T33": [1202, 1218], "T34": [1330, 1345], "T35": [1358, 1373], "T36": [1428, 1445], "T37": [1556, 1584], "T38": [1588, 1591], "T39": [1644, 1655], "T40": [1656, 1671], "T41": [1723, 1726], "T42": [1738, 1755], "T44": [138, 159], "T9": [263, 264], "T48": [460, 463], "T49": [688, 691], "T50": [741, 743], "T51": [979, 990], "T53": [1154, 1175], "T54": [1321, 1329], "T55": [1419, 1427], "T56": [1635, 1643], "T57": [1, 21], "T58": [110, 123], "T43": [271, 277], "T45": [291, 309], "T59": [780, 799], "T60": [665, 683], "T52": [1177, 1183], "T61": [1229, 1247], "T69": [1374, 1389], "T2": [80, 93], "T3": [125, 131], "T5": [265, 270], "T31": [1148, 1153], "T46": [357, 362], "T47": [369, 370], "T62": [375, 378]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Equivalent", "R2": "Target", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Target", "R6": "Equivalent", "R7": "Equivalent", "R8": "Target", "R9": "Target", "R10": "Target", "R11": "Target", "R12": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["T14", "T48"], "R2": ["T48", "T13"], "R3": ["E2", "T43"], "R4": ["E3", "T53"], "R6": ["T11", "T47"], "R7": ["T11", "T62"], "R8": ["E2", "T10"], "R9": ["E2", "T45"], "R10": ["E3", "T52"], "R11": ["E3", "T32"], "R12": ["E3", "T33"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T3", "E2": "T5", "E3": "T31"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Site", "T44"], ["Dopant", "T6"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T9"]], "E3": [["Dopant", "T30"]]}}, {"text": "The new ternary phase U34Fe4\u2212 x Ge33 has been synthesized and characterized by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetization, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, specific heat, electrical resistivity, magnetoresistivity and thermopower measurements.

Structure refinement confirmed six inequivalent U atoms, occupying sites with dissimilar coordination, the Ge atoms staying on seven positions and Fe on two positions, one of the Fe sites with a partial occupancy. The U sub-lattice is composed by the stacking of a square cupola, two distorted cubes and a square orthobicupola. U34Fe4\u2212 x Ge33 with x =0.68 undergoes a ferromagnetic-type transition below 28K. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy shows that the magnetism is ruled by the U sub-lattice, as Fe atoms have no ordered moments.

Since Langmuir\u2013Blodgett films of alkylammonium\u2013M(dmit)2 generally exhibit superconductivity, it may be possible to develop novel electronic molecular devices on the subnanometer scale. In the bulk state, several alkylammonium\u2013M(dmit)2 molecules could not form a highly ordered layered structure along the c-axis and a subcell structure of the alkyl chain in the ab-plane; however, almost all molecules formed a layered structure in the film multilayers. Monolayers of alkylammonium\u2013M(dmit)2 molecules on the water surface were extremely condensed. Out-of-plane and in-plane XRD measurements revealed that over a long period, systematic changes occurred in the two-dimensional lattice structure of alkylammonium\u2013M(dmit)2 molecules and not in their bulk state. These structural changes appear to be caused by enhancement of the van der Waals interaction among long hydrocarbons and the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction among (dmit)2 units arranged two dimensionally. In addition, both the molecular arrangement and the structural morphology of the films showed dependence on the hydrocarbon chain length, number of long alkyl chains, and kind of central metal. In particular, the molecular arrangement of materials having didecyl chains changed drastically and (dmit)2 units were highly oriented in the ab-plane.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of these samples have shown an orthorhombic crystal structure following PMMM space group. The added CNTs have been found to diffuse at the inter-grain sites and act as cementing material. SEM images show that CNTs are forming an electrical-network between grains. These observations suggest that the CNT addition to the CuTl-1223 compounds improve the electrical connection between superconducting grains which in turn increase the J c of the final compound. The room temperature resistivity of as-prepared samples decreases with the addition of CNT. The onset temperature of superconductivity [T c(onset)] and zero resistivity critical temperature [T c(R =0)] are found to decrease with the CNT additions. Except for the samples with CNT additions of 0.25%, the density [mass/volume] of final compound after CNT addition is decreased. Magnitude of diamagnetism is also suppressed with the addition of CNT which suggests that some of carbon atoms diffuse into the unit cells at the intra-grain sites.

The out of phase component of magnetic susceptibility observed as a broad peak in the as-prepared samples, is transformed to a sharp peaks after post-annealing of the samples in oxygen atmosphere. This shows that oxygen diffusion converts the inter-grain material to respective oxides and carbonates that increase the surface areas of the current flow around inter-grain loops that reduce the hysteresis losses. The electron-microscopy of these samples has shown that inter-grain voids population is suppressed with the addition of CNTs.

Ceramics of Bi1.6Pb0.4Sr2Ca1\u2212x Y x Cu2O8+d (called CY series) and Bi1.6Pb0.4Sr2\u2212x Y x CaCu2O8+d (called SY series) with x=0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 are elaborated in air by conventional solid state reaction. They are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), density, Vickers microhardness and resistivity measurements. The refinement of cell parameters is done by considering the structural modulation. In comparison with the undoped sample (x=0), the cell parameters a, b and c are reduced by the doping for both series while the b component of the modulation vector increases. A good correlation between the variations of the bulk density and the Vickers microhardness with x is obtained. For both series, the SEM analysis shows that the doped samples exhibit a reduced grain size than that of the undoped one. The variation of resistivity with temperature shows that all samples exhibit a metallic-like character in the normal state. For all doping levels, the CY series presents higher onset critical transition temperature than that of the undoped sample, which is equal to 85.43K. The opposite is obtained for SY series. The highest value of this temperature is obtained for x=0.075 in the doped samples and is about 92.15 and 79.96K for CY and SY series, respectively. These values may correspond to a near optimally doped state since the slope (d\u03c1/dT) of resistivity shows a maximum at the same value of x=0.075. For both series, when Y3+ is introduced into the samples, the residual resistivity decreases first for x=0.025 and increases gradually after this value until x=0.1.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Element", "T3": "Element", "T4": "Element", "T5": "Element", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Main", "T8": "Material", "T9": "Element", "T10": "Element", "T11": "Process", "T12": "Process", "T13": "Characterization", "T14": "Characterization", "T16": "Characterization", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T20": "Material", "T21": "Material", "T23": "Material", "T26": "Property", "T27": "Property", "T28": "Characterization", "T30": "Material", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T36": "Element", "T40": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T43": "Element", "T45": "Property", "T46": "Element", "T47": "Property", "T51": "Element", "T55": "Element", "T62": "Characterization", "T63": "Value", "T65": "Value", "T66": "Value", "T68": "Value", "T70": "Value", "T72": "Value", "T73": "Value", "T50": "Value", "T54": "Value", "T57": "Value", "T58": "Value", "T59": "Value", "T74": "Value", "T75": "Material", "T76": "Material", "T77": "Material", "T25": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T64": "Characterization", "T1": "Doping", "T22": "Doping", "T24": "Doping", "T29": "Doping", "T31": "Doping", "T37": "SC", "T38": "SC", "T35": "Doping", "T39": "Doping"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [76, 79], "T3": [89, 91], "T4": [110, 112], "T5": [123, 127], "T6": [128, 134], "T7": [138, 149], "T8": [170, 178], "T9": [182, 212], "T10": [236, 265], "T11": [340, 343], "T12": [360, 380], "T13": [408, 425], "T14": [427, 430], "T16": [465, 468], "T17": [471, 478], "T18": [480, 501], "T20": [550, 565], "T21": [593, 614], "T23": [665, 680], "T26": [841, 853], "T27": [862, 883], "T28": [925, 928], "T30": [985, 990], "T32": [1043, 1054], "T33": [1105, 1113], "T34": [1136, 1148], "T36": [1177, 1179], "T40": [1329, 1331], "T42": [1457, 1459], "T43": [1464, 1466], "T45": [1576, 1587], "T46": [1656, 1659], "T47": [1705, 1716], "T51": [221, 223], "T55": [274, 276], "T62": [433, 463], "T63": [657, 658], "T65": [1436, 1441], "T66": [1446, 1452], "T68": [1627, 1632], "T70": [1794, 1797], "T72": [1396, 1401], "T73": [1292, 1298], "T50": [292, 293], "T54": [295, 300], "T57": [302, 306], "T58": [308, 313], "T59": [318, 321], "T74": [1739, 1744], "T75": [681, 682], "T76": [690, 691], "T77": [684, 685], "T25": [763, 780], "T19": [506, 517], "T64": [518, 530], "T1": [51, 57], "T22": [711, 717], "T24": [953, 958], "T29": [1158, 1164], "T31": [1409, 1414], "T37": [1203, 1240], "T38": [1361, 1377], "T35": [1537, 1542], "T39": [1663, 1673]}, "r_type_dict": {"R3": "Target", "R4": "Target", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Equivalent", "R8": "Target", "R9": "Condition", "R10": "Equivalent", "R11": "Equivalent", "R12": "Condition", "R13": "Condition", "R14": "Target", "R15": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R3": ["T65", "T42"], "R4": ["T66", "T43"], "R5": ["E2", "T7"], "R6": ["E1", "T7"], "R7": ["T37", "T73"], "R8": ["E5", "T36"], "R9": ["T73", "E5"], "R10": ["T38", "T65"], "R11": ["T38", "T66"], "R12": ["T65", "E6"], "R13": ["T66", "E6"], "R14": ["E6", "T42"], "R15": ["E6", "T43"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping", "E8": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T1", "E2": "T1", "E3": "T22", "E4": "T24", "E5": "T29", "E6": "T31", "E7": "T35", "E8": "T39"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T2"], ["Site", "T3"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T2"], ["Site", "T4"]], "E3": [], "E4": [], "E5": [], "E6": [], "E7": [], "E8": [["Dopant", "T46"]]}}, {"text": "The fluctuation-induced conductivity (FIC) above critical temperature (T c) was measured in Cd doped (Cu0.5Tl0.5)Ba2Ca3(Cu4\u2212y Cd y )O12\u2212\u03b4 (y =0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) as prepared and oxygen post-annealed superconductors using the Aslamazov\u2013Larkin (AL) and Maki\u2013Thompson (MT) models.

The heavy copper sections of the current leads used for energising the HTS field winding were replaced by cryogenic power electronics; consisting of the converter and a rotor control unit. The converter board was designed using an H-bridge configuration with two 5A rated wires connecting the cryogenic boards to the stator control board located on the outside of the generator and drawing power from a (5A, 50V) dc power source. The robustness of converter board was well demonstrated when it was powered up from a cold start at 82K. When charging the field winding with moderate currents (30A), the heat in-leak to the \u2018cold\u2019 rotor core was only 2W. It continued to function down to 74K, surviving several quenches. However, the quench protection function failed when injecting 75A into the field winding, resulting in the burn out of one of the DC-link capacitors. The magnitudes of the critical currents measured with the original current leads were compared to the quench currents, which was defined as the current which triggered quench protection protocol. The difference between the two currents was rather large, (\u223c20A).

Besides, the highest T c offset value of 69.6 K is observed for the former sample at 7 T external field strength.

The spin density wave (SDW) ordering that occurs in these systems at temperatures T \u223c (120\u2013140) K, in close vicinity to a tetragonal/orthorhombic transition, produces significant modifications in their magneto-transport properties. While in the magnetically ordered phase the MR is positive and its magnitude increases with decreasing temperatures, in the paramagnetic regime the MR becomes vanishingly small. Above the spin density wave transition temperature (T SDW) the Hall coefficient RH is negative, small and weakly temperature dependent, but a remarkable change of slope occurs in the RH versus T curves at T = T SDW . The Hall coefficient amplitude, while remaining negative, increases steadily and significantly as the temperature is decreased below T SDW and down to T = 20 K.

Both TiO2 and BaO2 doping tends to enter the crystal lattice of the superconducting matrix by ionic substitution, which leads to the variable peak effect in the J c\u2013B diagram. The BaTiO3 doping method shows a unique pinning behavior, which is attributed to the distinctive precipitations generated by the additions.

The critical current density has been calculated by the Bean model, and the irreversibility field, H irr, has been obtained by the Kramer method. The pinning mechanism of the co-doped sample with 2% Al and 5% SiC was investigated in particular due to its having the highest H irr. The normalized volume pinning force f = F/F max as a function of reduced magnetic field h = H/H irr has been obtained, and the pinning mechanism was studied by the Dew-Houghes model. It was found that the normal point pinning (NPP), the normal surface pinning (NSP), and the normal volume pinning (NVP) mechanisms play the main roles. The magnetic field and temperature dependence of contributions of the NPP, NSP, and NVP pinning mechanisms were obtained.

From the temperature dependence of the critical current density within the collective pinning theory, it was found that both the \u03b4l pinning due to spatial fluctuations of the charge-carrier mean free path and the \u03b4T c pinning due to randomly distributed spatial variations in the transition temperature coexist at zero magnetic field in co-doped samples.

The Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate that no structural distortion is induced by the doping of Na in Cu1\u2212x Na x Ir2S4, which excludes the lattice distortion effect. The tendency to metallic behavior with the doping of Na indicates a hybridization between Na+ and surrounding S2\u2212 ions via the outer shell p electrons, which enhances the itinerant characteristic of electrons.

In conventional superconductors like niobium or lead, the normal state is a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface and well-defined quasipartcles along the Fermi surface. Superconductivity is realized in this case by the Fermi surface instability in the superconducting state and the formation and condensation of the electron pairs (Cooper pairing). The high temperature cuprate superconductors, on the other hand, represent another extreme case that superconductivity can be realized in the underdoped region where there is neither well-defined Fermi surface due to the pseudogap formation nor quasiparticles near the antinodal regions in the normal state. Here we report a novel scenario that superconductivity is realized in a system with well-defined Fermi surface but without quasiparticles along the Fermi surface in the normal state. High resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been performed on an optimally-doped iron-based superconductor (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2. We find that, while sharp superconducting coherence peaks emerge in the superconducting state on the hole-like Fermi surface sheets, no quasiparticle peak is present in the normal state. Its electronic behaviours deviate strongly from a Fermi liquid system. The superconducting gap of such a system exhibits an unusual temperature dependence that it is nearly a constant in the superconducting state and abruptly closes at T c .

This is similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early transition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that N0(EF) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE.

The behaviour under pressure of the isotope effect coefficient can be explained taking into account the change in T c due to the change in both, the electron-phonon and the electron-electron interactions.

These systems are represented by an infinite layered structure containing a mixture of paired and unpaired fermions. The former, which stand for the superconducting carriers, are considered as noninteracting zero spin composite-bosons with a linear energy\u2013momentum dispersion relation in the CuO2 planes where superconduction is predominant, coexisting with the unpaired fermions in a pattern of stacked slabs. The inter-slab, penetrable, infinite planes are generated by a Dirac comb potential, while paired and unpaired electrons (or holes) are free to move parallel to the planes. Composite-bosons condense at a critical temperature at which they exhibit a jump in their specific heat. These two values are assumed to be equal to the superconducting critical temperature Tc and the specific heat jump reported for YBa2Cu3O6.80 to fix our model parameters namely, the plane impenetrability and the fraction of superconducting charge carriers. We then calculate the isochoric and isobaric electronic specific heats for temperatures lower than Tc of both, the composite-bosons and the unpaired fermions, which matches the latest experimental curves.

In this paper, we interested in Y134 (YBa3Cu4O9-y) and Y145 (YBa4Cu5O11-y) superconductor found in 2010. To investigate the effect of Ag2O addition on some properties of Y134 and Y145 superconductor, these superconductors doped with Ag2O were synthesized by solid state reaction. The calcinations and sintering temperature were at 920 \u00b0C and annealing temperature was at 550 \u00b0C. The highest critical temperature was found in doped 0.1Ag sample with Tc onset at 97 K and 96 K, the lowest critical temperature was found in pure sample with Tc onset at 91 K and 95 K for Y134 and Y145, respectively.

From the TEP and the superconducting transition temperature (T c) we conclude that Sr/Ba substitution decreases the carrier concentration of the Cr doped samples and seems to cause some pair breaking, and also that Ca substitution partially restores the hole density in agreement with the conclusions of Babu and Greaves [Physica C 207 (1993) 44]. Using the room-temperature TEP as a guide, we find that Cr doping causes less change in the carrier concentration than Co doping and suggest that its vortex pinning properties should be investigated. Resistivity and TEP for the Ga doped samples give evidence for a gap in the spin-excitation spectrum. This gap is not visible in the static susceptibility because of the presence of a significant Curie term, but electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements show that these spins are not from impurity phases.

A pronounced enhancement of the pseudogap under pressure of dln\u0394\u2217/dP \u2248 0.32, which is only a factor of 1.12 smaller than in slightly doped single crystals, is revealed for the first time.

Simultaneously, the ratio 2\u0394\u2217(T c )/k B T c \u2248 5 at P = 0 GPa, which is typical for high-temperature superconductors with strong coupling, increases by 16% with increasing pressure.

Characteristic normal state properties appear to be beyond the conventional framework of Landau's Fermi liquid theory. Spin correlations among the charge carriers are discussed as a possible source for the intricate electronic properties. The low energy physics is determined by the charge and spin dynamics in CuO2 layers which all cuprate superconductors have in common despite their otherwise complex composition. Strong short range Coulomb repulsion between the charge carriers in these planar units imply magnetic ordering phenomena among the Cu spins. Depending on the doping controlled carrier concentration the cuprate compounds are either antiferromagnetic (AF) insulators or correlated metals with short range spin correlations extending also into the superconducting state. The purpose of this article is twofold: In the first part we review results of basic experiments which probe the magnetic correlations in the CuO2 planes. Particular emphasis is given on neutron and Raman scattering, nuclear magnetic relaxation, and a selected set of experiments which contain information about the nature of the superconducting state. Based on these experiments the evolution of the spin dynamics from the AF insulator into the doped metallic regime will be discussed. On the other hand we give an overview of current phenomenological and microscopic approaches in the context of purely electronic Hubbard type models which focus on the role of AF spin fluctuations. This includes the results for single particle properties as well as for the dynamic spin susceptibility. Special attention is given to the discussion of spin fluctuation exchange as the possible mechanism underlying high temperature superconductivity.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Property", "T4": "Property", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T8": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Material", "T11": "SC", "T12": "Property", "T13": "Property", "T14": "Property", "T16": "Property", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T22": "SC", "T23": "Property", "T24": "Material", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Property", "T27": "SC", "T28": "Property", "T29": "Property", "T30": "Property", "T32": "Property", "T33": "Property", "T34": "Property", "T35": "Property", "T37": "Property", "T39": "SC", "T40": "Element", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Element", "T3": "Property", "T5": "Property", "T44": "Property", "T45": "Property", "T47": "Characterization", "T36": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T43": "Property", "T48": "Characterization", "T1": "SC", "T38": "Main", "T15": "Doping", "T31": "Doping", "T46": "Element", "T20": "Material"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [188, 200], "T4": [284, 290], "T6": [320, 326], "T7": [416, 426], "T8": [456, 462], "T9": [467, 471], "T10": [489, 495], "T11": [506, 529], "T12": [639, 645], "T13": [683, 700], "T14": [724, 729], "T16": [766, 787], "T17": [821, 838], "T18": [840, 842], "T19": [844, 854], "T22": [935, 950], "T23": [1071, 1092], "T24": [1105, 1111], "T25": [1183, 1191], "T26": [1192, 1202], "T27": [1288, 1303], "T28": [1359, 1363], "T29": [1382, 1384], "T30": [1385, 1394], "T32": [1410, 1418], "T33": [1587, 1593], "T34": [1621, 1623], "T35": [1624, 1641], "T37": [1796, 1812], "T39": [1859, 1893], "T40": [484, 488], "T41": [721, 723], "T42": [1100, 1104], "T3": [262, 283], "T5": [292, 309], "T44": [151, 171], "T45": [609, 626], "T47": [1145, 1152], "T36": [1727, 1746], "T21": [893, 910], "T43": [104, 114], "T48": [1157, 1173], "T1": [62, 77], "T38": [54, 61], "T15": [748, 754], "T31": [1404, 1409], "T46": [792, 799], "T20": [869, 875]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E1", "T46"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T15", "E2": "T31"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [], "E2": []}}, {"text": "Nonresonant Microwave Absorption (NRMA) or the \u2018Low field microwave absorption\u2019 (LFMA) measurements on high quality Ni nanoparticle added YBCO powder (Ni-YBCO) were carried as a function of temperature.

[19], we present a detailed study of the competition and interplay between the d-density wave (DDW) and d-wave superconductivity (DSC) within the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation for the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model. In order to stabilize the DDW state with respect to phase separation at lower dopings a small nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion is included within the Hartree\u2013Fock approximation. We solve the coupled gap equations for the DDW, DSC, and \u03c0-pairing as the possible order parameters, which are caused by exchange of spin fluctuations, together with calculating the spin fluctuation pairing interaction self-consistently within the FLEX approximation. We show that even when nesting of the Fermi surface is perfect, as in a square lattice with only nearest-neighbor hopping, there is coexistence of DSC and DDW in a large region of dopings close to the quantum critical point (QCP) at which the DDW state vanishes. In particular, we find that in the presence of DDW order the superconducting transition temperature T c can be much higher compared to pure superconductivity, since the pairing interaction is strongly enhanced due to the feedback effect on spin fluctuations of the DDW gap. \u03c0-pairing appears generically in the coexistence region, but its feedback on the other order parameters is very small. In the present work, we have developed a weak-coupling theory of the competition between DDW and DSC in 2D Hubbard model, using the static spin fluctuation obtained within FLEX approximation and ignoring the self-energy effect of spin fluctuations.

[C. R. Phys. 12 (2011) 446] published in the issue of C. R. Physique dedicated to superconductivity. By including this article to the present issue on physics in high magnetic field, we have aimed, in agreement with the editorial board of the review, offering a complete issue and also reporting on the last developments in the study of superconductors in high field. We review how experiments in very high magnetic fields over the last five years have given a new twist to the understanding of the normal state of hole-doped cuprate superconductors. The discovery of quantum oscillations in underdoped YBa2Cu3O y and overdoped Tl2Ba2CuO6+ \u03b4 has proven the existence of a Fermi surface across the whole phase diagram, which had been a controversial issue for more than twenty years. However, the striking difference in oscillation frequency for the two compounds has revealed a very different Fermi surface topology. The observation of negative Hall and Seebeck coefficients in the underdoped materials has shown that the large hole-like Fermi surface of overdoped materials undergoes a reconstruction in the high field and low temperature limits for which quantum oscillation can be observed. This has been interpreted as evidence for a translational symmetry breaking due to some form of electronic (spin, charge, or orbital current) order. The angular dependence of the quantum oscillations has constrained the source of the Fermi-surface reconstruction to something other than a spin-density wave with moments perpendicular to the field. Finally, nuclear magnetic resonance studies have revealed that it is actually charge order, without spin order, which is induced in the copper oxide planes as soon as superconductivity is sufficiently weakened by the magnetic field.

Using in situ solid state reaction, four different doped samples of Mg(B.98C.02)2 were prepared by mixing powders of Mg, boron and glucose for 2h, 4h, 8h and 12h using planetary ball milling. A reference sample of un-doped MgB2 was also prepared under same conditions. The particle size distribution of the un-reacted samples show a decrease in the particle size as the BMT is increased. Both the average particle size as well as the standard deviation show a substantial decrease with the increase in the milling time up to 8h. After 8h, the size reduction is rather insignificant. From the XRD data, the crystallite size of the doped MgB2 computed using the Scherrer formula was found to decrease with the increasing BMT, showing a saturation level after 8h of the milling time. TEM images also confirm the crystallite size obtained from the XRD data. The substitution of the C in the MgB2 lattice, measured from the change in the c/a ratio, increases with increasing BMT. The maximum carbon substitution is achieved at approximately 8h of BMT. Moreover, a systematic enhancement of the residual resistivity and a decrease in T C with an increasing BMT further confirms a progressive substitution of the carbon in the MgB2. These results suggest that a minimum ball milling time is necessary to disperse the glucose uniformly for a maximum substitution of nano C in the B plane of MgB2 lattice. The optimum BMT is found to be 8h. Thus, the decrease in the particle size due to the ball milling enhances the dispersion of the constituent materials thereby favoring a greater substitution of the dopant in the MgB2 during the solid-state reaction.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Process", "T3": "Element", "T4": "Element", "T6": "Main", "T7": "Process", "T9": "Element", "T10": "Material", "T11": "Element", "T12": "Element", "T13": "Element", "T14": "Process", "T16": "Element", "T17": "Material", "T18": "Material", "T19": "Material", "T21": "Characterization", "T23": "Element", "T24": "Characterization", "T25": "Characterization", "T27": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Material", "T30": "Element", "T32": "Property", "T33": "SC", "T35": "Element", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Process", "T40": "Material", "T41": "Element", "T42": "Material", "T43": "Material", "T44": "Process", "T45": "Material", "T47": "Material", "T48": "Element", "T49": "Process", "T51": "Value", "T52": "Value", "T53": "Value", "T54": "Value", "T55": "Value", "T56": "Element", "T57": "Value", "T58": "Value", "T59": "Value", "T60": "Value", "T61": "Element", "T62": "Process", "T63": "Process", "T64": "Process", "T20": "Property", "T65": "Process", "T66": "Process", "T67": "Process", "T68": "Process", "T69": "Process", "T70": "Process", "T50": "Process", "T2": "Doping", "T5": "Doping", "T8": "Doping", "T15": "Doping", "T22": "Doping", "T26": "Doping", "T31": "Doping", "T34": "Doping", "T38": "Doping", "T39": "Material", "T46": "Element"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [18, 35], "T3": [69, 75], "T4": [83, 90], "T6": [97, 101], "T7": [146, 166], "T9": [200, 213], "T10": [238, 245], "T11": [249, 251], "T12": [253, 258], "T13": [263, 270], "T14": [310, 322], "T16": [355, 359], "T17": [405, 418], "T18": [481, 489], "T19": [529, 550], "T21": [724, 727], "T23": [768, 772], "T24": [913, 916], "T25": [976, 979], "T27": [1010, 1011], "T28": [1019, 1023], "T29": [1024, 1031], "T30": [1119, 1125], "T32": [1221, 1241], "T33": [1260, 1263], "T35": [1338, 1344], "T36": [1352, 1356], "T37": [1395, 1407], "T40": [1506, 1511], "T41": [1515, 1519], "T42": [1520, 1527], "T43": [1590, 1603], "T44": [1615, 1627], "T45": [1671, 1680], "T47": [1728, 1734], "T48": [1742, 1746], "T49": [1758, 1778], "T51": [275, 277], "T52": [657, 659], "T53": [667, 669], "T54": [889, 891], "T55": [1168, 1170], "T56": [1504, 1505], "T57": [1560, 1562], "T58": [279, 281], "T59": [283, 285], "T60": [290, 293], "T61": [1442, 1449], "T62": [37, 40], "T63": [502, 505], "T64": [638, 650], "T20": [792, 808], "T65": [851, 854], "T66": [899, 911], "T67": [1102, 1105], "T68": [1174, 1177], "T69": [1283, 1286], "T70": [1541, 1544], "T50": [231, 237], "T2": [49, 61], "T5": [91, 96], "T8": [183, 188], "T15": [762, 767], "T22": [990, 1002], "T26": [1126, 1138], "T31": [1318, 1330], "T34": [1474, 1486], "T38": [1708, 1720], "T39": [1490, 1494], "T46": [1495, 1496]}, "r_type_dict": {"R1": "Target", "R2": "Target", "R3": "Target", "R4": "Target", "R5": "Target", "R6": "Target", "R7": "Target", "R8": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R1": ["E1", "T6"], "R2": ["E2", "T6"], "R3": ["E3", "T9"], "R4": ["E4", "T23"], "R5": ["E5", "T28"], "R6": ["E7", "T36"], "R7": ["E8", "T41"], "R8": ["E9", "T48"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping", "E2": "Doping", "E3": "Doping", "E4": "Doping", "E5": "Doping", "E6": "Doping", "E7": "Doping", "E8": "Doping", "E9": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T2", "E2": "T5", "E3": "T8", "E4": "T15", "E5": "T22", "E6": "T26", "E7": "T31", "E8": "T34", "E9": "T38"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T3"]], "E2": [["Dopant", "T4"]], "E3": [], "E4": [], "E5": [["Dopant", "T27"]], "E6": [["Dopant", "T30"]], "E7": [["Dopant", "T35"]], "E8": [["Site", "T56"], ["Dopant", "T46"]], "E9": []}}, {"text": "This chapter discusses some of the current topics in the analysis of the optical conductivity of high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

The van der Waals (vdW) bonding between NbSe2 layers makes it a good platform for tuning the crystal structure, CDW, and superconducting gap by intercalation. Here we report the crystal structure and superconductivity of Rb-intercalated NbSe2 prepared by solid-state reaction. For Rb intercalation with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.025, there is only one phase with space group P63/mmc. With Rb intercalation, T c of RbxNbSe2 decreases from 7.2 K for x = 0 to 4.2 K for x = 0.025 in an L-shaped way. The suppression rate of T c is similar to the one with magnetic Fe doping, but much quicker than those with Li, Ga, and Cu doping. The superconducting phase diagram of RbxNbSe2 is established accordingly and is compared with those of LixNbSe2, CuxNbSe2, FexNbSe2, and GaxNbSe2.

As a result, the suppression of Sm/Ba substitution in the Sm1+xBa2\u2212xCu3O7\u2212\u03b4 phase matrix (SmBCO, where x represents the Sm/Ba substitution level in the SmBCO system) is critical to achieving good superconducting properties in this material. Here we report the use of Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA) to investigate, adjust and optimise the composition of mechanically-stabilised standard Ag-SmBCO bulk single grains. We show that the substitution levels within these samples changes linearly within increasing distance from the vicinity of a single crystal seed used to nucleate the single grain growth process. In addition, we identify a constant value of x of \u22120.080 for the composition-adjusted Ag-SmBCO bulk single grain. This is the first time that the quantification of the Sm/Ba substitution level in the SmBCO system has been measured accurately and directly using EPMA, and suggests clearly that the Sm/Ba substitution can be suppressed effectively in air.

Similar observations are carried out on sintered YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 samples with reduced oxygen content and on electron-irradiated samples. The penetration of flux into sintered high-T c superconductors is found to be totally different from single crystalline materials (single crystals and epitaxial thin films) as the Abrikosov vortices penetrate the sample not as a whole thus forming a so-called flux front. Only a flux penetration into single superconducting grains is observed. From the measured flux density profiles, the intragrain critical current densities are determined locally. It is found that the chemical impurity phases do not affect the intragranular flux density distribution and the intragranular critical current density, but the decomposition of the Ag2O leads to an improved oxygen stoichiometry in these samples. Electron irradiation is found to enhance the intragrain critical current densities, whereas the oxygen reduction leads to reduced intragrain currents. To determine the influence of the additions also on the intergrain critical current densities, standard four-point transport current measurements are carried out on the same samples. It is found that a maximum enhancement of the critical current density is obtained by the addition of 10 wt% silver oxide; however, this critical current density is drastically reduced by applying small external magnetic fields. The lower critical field of the matrix and the corresponding Josephson penetration depth are determined from transport current measurements. The Ag2O additions and the green phase particles are found to separate the superconducting YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 grains.

A strong covalent bonding character between TM adatom and germanene layer is found in most of TM/germanene adsorption systems. By means of adsorption, the germanene can exhibit various electronic and magnetic properties depending on the adatom species, such as nonmagnetic metal (Cu adsorption), nonmagnetic semiconductor (Ni or Zn adsorption), ferromagnetic metal (Cr or Mn adsorption), ferromagnetic semiconductor (V adsorption), and more particular, ferromagnetic half-metal (Sc, Ti, Fe or Co adsorption) with 100% spin-polarization at the Fermi level. In addition, Cr adatom introduces the largest magnetic moment in germanene, while Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe and Co adatoms all generate nearly integer magnetic moments. The effects of the on-site Coulomb interaction as well as the magnetic interaction between TM adatoms on the stability of the half-metallic TM/germanene systems are also considered, and the results show that the half-metallic states for the Sc/germanene and Ti/germanene are all robust.

Doping produces carriers in either the charge reservoir layers or in the CuO2 layers. Increasing the concentration of mobile carriers in the CuO2 layers initially induces superconductivity until a maximum Tc is reached which corresponds to approximately 0.2 hole carriers per copper atom. Thereafter Tc decreases and the non-superconducting metallic state is reached at a carrier concentration which is somewhat below \u02dc0.5 hole carriers per copper atom. We have carried out a study of the relationship between the insulating, the superconducting and the non-superconducting metallic in detail on a number of systems. A particular example will be given of the family of (Ca1-x Yx)Sr2(Tl1-zPbzCu2)O7 compounds where both x and z can be varied; the highest Tc is 108K while the non-superconducting metallic member is given by the formula CaSr2(TlCu2)O7 and the insulating state is given by the composition with z=0.5 and y>0.6. Other combinations are also possible, giving this family of materials their inherently very interesting properties for investigative studies as well as for practical applications. In addition to the variation in Tc as a function of carrier concentration and determined from the temperature dependent resistivity, other measurements on the structure, Hall coefficients, thermo-electric power, magnetisation and specific heat have revealed further interests relating to superconducting order parameters, critical currents, dimensionality and other superconductivity properties in these materials. We have found that variations in the fluctuation superconductivity, thermo-power and magneto-resistance strongly suggest that two qualitatively different regimes exist within the superconducting range of the composition. In the low carrier density regime the Cooper pairs may be compared with the real space spin bi-polarons. In the high carrier density regime strongly interacting BCS behaviour dominate.

In addition an integrated scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) or atomic force microscope (AFM) tip allows the simultaneous measurement of the sample topography, which can then be correlated with magnetic images. SHPM has several advantages over alternative methods; it is almost completely non-invasive, can be used over a very wide range of temperatures (0.3\u2013300K) and magnetic fields (0\u20137T) and yields quantitative maps of the z-component of magnetic induction. The approach is particularly well suited to low temperature imaging of vortices in type II superconductors with very high signal:noise ratios and relatively high spatial resolution (>100nm).

It contains also information for the structural peculiarities of YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x superconductors and data for oxygen reactivity from temperature-programmed reduction, oxygen isotopic exchange and oxygen desorption measurements. A distinct correlation between the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x and its catalytic activity in ortho-para hydrogen conversion is observed. Data in the literature show an influence of the oxygen vacancies concentration in these solids and their activity and selectivity. However, in many cases no relationship seems to exist between the superconducting properties and the catalytic activity and selectivity. This is explained by: (i) the experiments were performed at temperatures much higher than T c and (ii) significant surface and bulk alterations in high-T c super-conductors during the catalytic reactions, as concluded from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data (appearance of Cu+ and Cu0 states in the surface layers, orthorhombic/tetragonal phase transition, and, in some cases, decomposition and phase segregation). The outstanding importance of oxygen binding energy for complete oxidation reactions is already shown. From the practical point of view, the high activities and selectivities should be noted of high-T c superconductors in selective oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes, in nitric oxide reduction by carbon monoxide and in ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile. Special attention should be paid to some related non-superconducting cuprates, which show high performances for complete oxidation reactions, with specific catalytic activities commensurable to those of the best catalysts known until now (e.g., Pt, Co3O4).

Zr diffusion is examined in the temperature range 500\u2013945\u00b0C via the variation of the lattice parameters evaluated from the XRD patterns. It is found that while the room-temperature resistivity reduces in the presence of the Zr ions in the system, the critical transition temperature values measured enhance. The onset ( T c onset ) and offset ( T c offset ) critical temperatures are found to be about 94.4K and 91.5K for the Zr-diffused sample as against 93.7K and 89.4K, respectively, for the pure sample. The increase in the critical temperatures is due to the improvement of crystallinity and the enhancement in the grain size. Likewise, the presence of the Zr atoms in the system, the J c value enhances from 128Acm\u22122 to 160Acm\u22122 at 77K owing to the increase of the flux pinning mechanism stemming from the stacking faults, planar and micro-defects. Further, XRD measurements display that the samples produced in this work exhibit the polycrystalline superconducting phase with the changing intensity of diffraction lines and contain the Y123 phase only, illustrating the incorporation of Zr atoms into the crystalline structure of the Zr-diffused sample. Based on the refinement of cell parameters done by considering the structural modulation, the Zr diffusion is confirmed by both a reduction of a and b lattice parameters and an enhancement of the cell parameter c (about 0.24%) of the sample in comparison with that of the pure sample. As for the SEM investigations, the crystallinity and grain connectivity improve with the Zr diffusion. According to the results obtained, the T c onset , T c offset and J c values of the samples studied are found to depend strongly on the microstructure. Moreover, EDX measurements indicate that the elements used for the preparation of samples distribute homogeneously. Y3+ and Ba2+ cations may partly be substituted by Zr4+ ions and the substitution at the Cu site is less likely, presenting that the superconducting properties of the Zr-diffused sample are more superior to the pure sample. Further, the diffusion coefficient of the Zr in Y123 system in a range of 500\u2013945\u00b0C is determined to change from 4.12\u00d710\u221210 to 9.77\u00d710\u22128 cm2 s\u22121 with activation energy of about 1.010eV, confirming that the Zr diffusion at lower temperatures is much less significant and the Zr ions primarily proceed through defects in the polycrystalline samples.",

A great variety of spatial broken symmetries occur in the semiconducting states proximate to SC in the CTS, including charge ordering, antiferromagnetism and spin-density wave, spin-Peierls state and the quantum spin liquid. We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states necessarily requires explicit incorporation of strong electron\u2013electron interactions and lattice discreteness, and most importantly, the correct bandfilling of one-quarter, as opposed to the effective half-filled band picture that is often employed. Uniquely in the quarter-filled band, there is a very strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin\u2013singlets, in both one- and two-dimension. The spin\u2013singlet in the quarter-filled band is necessarily charge-disproportionated, with charge-rich pairs of nearest neighbor sites separated by charge-poor pairs of sites in the insulating state. Thus the tendency to spin\u2013singlets, a quantum effect, drives a commensurate charge-order in the correlated quarter-filled band. This charge-ordered spin\u2013singlet, which we label as a paired-electron crystal (PEC), is different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state and the Wigner crystal (WC) of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken symmetries, the PEC is characterized by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in two dimension is enhanced by lattice frustration. The concept of the PEC mirrors parallel development of the idea of a density wave of Cooper pairs in the superconducting high T c cuprates, where also the existence of a charge-ordered state in between the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting phase has now been confirmed. Following this characterization of the spatial broken symmetries, we critically reexamine spin-fluctuation and resonating valence bond theories of frustration-driven SC within half-filled band Hubbard and Hubbard\u2013Heisenberg Hamiltonians for the superconducting CTS. We present numerical evidence for the absence of SC within the half-filled band correlated-electron Hamiltonians for any degree of frustration. We then develop a valence-bond theory of SC within which the superconducting state is reached by the destabilization of the PEC by additional pressure-induced lattice frustration that makes the spin\u2013singlets mobile. We present limited but accurate numerical evidence for the existence of such a charge order\u2013SC duality. Our proposed mechanism for SC is the same for CTS in which the proximate semiconducting state is antiferromagnetic instead of charge-ordered, with the only difference that SC in the former is generated via a fluctuating spin\u2013singlet state as opposed to static PEC.

The control of the oxidation state of the transition metal, via the monitoring of the oxygen content, is of prime importance to understand and optimize the properties, due to the strong coupling that exists between the lattice and the charges and spins of the transition metals.

The complementarity of studies is also addressed by the synthesis and characterization of single crystals in addition to poly-crystals.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements show that addition of Ga2O3 does not change the peritectic temperature of the mixtures. The microstructures of the Ga2O3-doped samples are similar to those observed in gallium-free samples.

Interestingly, only when the impurity content and the oxygenation condition are both suitable then the evident secondary magnetization peak (SMP) appears.

Tc and Ts showed decreasing trend with increasing x, followed by an additional AFM transition at TN =15K for x=0.6.

The superconducting transition temperature (T c) and critical current density (J c) of the prepared samples were estimated from electrical resistivity and transport critical current density measurements. It was found that T c decreases as nanosized MnFe2O4 addition increases, while J c enhances up to 0.02wt%.

Results of electronic structure calculations are presented in this paper in order to understand this difference in behavior, and to shed some light on the charge redistribution under pressure. Our calculations show that the charge redistributions under pressure are quite subtle, and that all sites participate in this charge redistribution. It is difficult to correctly understand the pressure dependence of T c without taking into account this charge redistribution. Roughly speaking, in the YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu4O8 families of superconductors, one can consider three separate structural components: CuO2 planes, CuO chains, and the ionic elements Y, Ba. There is always an increase of the electronic charge at the ionic sites under pressure, and this tends to increase the hole density in the CuO2 planes. The difference in behavior under pressure in YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu4O8 arises due to the chains. While in YBa2Cu4O8 they further accept the electronic charge, and hence further increase the hole density in the CuO2 planes, their behavior is quite the opposite in YBa2Cu3O7 where they transfer back the electronic charge and almost compensate for the accumulation of the electronic charge at the ionic sites. The final result is that there is an extremely small increase in the hole density under pressure in YBa2Cu3O7. This difference in behavior of the chains is of structural origin, namely single chain versus double chains, which affects the densities of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. At a pressure of 4.65 GPa in YBa2Cu4O8 we obtain an increase in the hole density of \u223c0.019 CuO 2 .

For the full characterization of the pure and Nd substituted Y-123 samples, the onset\u2013offset critical transition temperature, variation of transition temperature, crystal structure, grain size, phase purity and lattice parameters are determined and discussed clearly. The results demonstrate that the crucial characteristics given above improve with the increase in the Nd concentration level at the Ba-site in the superconducting core up until a critical value of x = 0.250 after which the characteristics tend to retrograde rapidly due to the transition of optimally doped state to the underdoped state position in the Y-123 superconducting lattice. This is in association with both the hole localization problem of the electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level and the presence of more disordered metallic state. The long and short of it is that the excess (0.250 < x) replacement of Ba inclusions for Nd impurities in the system leads to degradation of the major (Y-123) phase or increment of the minor phase (Y-211) in their intrinsic crystal structures with the phase transition from orthorhombic to pseudotetragonal in the crystal structure, being one of the most striking points deduced from this work. At the same time, the mechanical performance shows the similar trend (firstly increase then decrease) with the increase of the Nd inclusions inserted in the Y-123 superconducting matrix.

Fabrication of YBCO thick films with superconducting zero resistance transition, T c(o) of 90 K demonstrated the use of Ba2GdTaO6 as a suitable substrate for YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 superconducting films.", "t_type_dict": {"T1": "Material", "T2": "Process", "T3": "Process", "T4": "Material", "T5": "Material", "T6": "Material", "T7": "Material", "T8": "Property", "T9": "SC", "T10": "Material", "T11": "SC", "T12": "SC", "T14": "Material", "T15": "Material", "T20": "SC", "T21": "Material", "T22": "Main", "T23": "Value", "T24": "Element", "T25": "Element", "T26": "Element", "T28": "Element", "T29": "Element", "T30": "Element", "T31": "Element", "T32": "Value", "T33": "Element", "T34": "Element", "T35": "Value", "T36": "Element", "T37": "Element", "T17": "Material", "T39": "Material", "T41": "Process", "T13": "Doping", "T19": "SC", "T16": "SC", "T18": "Material"}, "t_span_dict": {"T1": [4, 11], "T2": [78, 86], "T3": [112, 132], "T4": [164, 169], "T5": [170, 180], "T6": [199, 216], "T7": [224, 240], "T8": [266, 285], "T9": [435, 450], "T10": [451, 456], "T11": [462, 477], "T12": [581, 596], "T14": [697, 707], "T15": [735, 740], "T20": [879, 894], "T21": [895, 900], "T22": [12, 21], "T23": [244, 251], "T24": [306, 315], "T25": [376, 379], "T26": [478, 489], "T28": [491, 495], "T29": [529, 538], "T30": [611, 615], "T31": [650, 659], "T32": [666, 673], "T33": [677, 681], "T34": [724, 728], "T35": [800, 804], "T36": [829, 838], "T37": [867, 878], "T17": [46, 58], "T39": [395, 404], "T41": [557, 571], "T13": [638, 646], "T19": [790, 796], "T16": [746, 788], "T18": [184, 198]}, "r_type_dict": {"R2": "Target", "R3": "Equivalent", "R5": "Target"}, "r_args_dict": {"R2": ["T35", "T34"], "R3": ["T19", "T35"], "R5": ["E1", "T30"]}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T13"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T31"]]}}, {"text": "We have fabricated Sm\ue5f8Ba\ue5f8Cu\ue5f8O thin films at 550\u2013850\u00b0C and at oxygen pressures of 1.2\u20136.0\u00d710\u22125 mbar in the presence of ozone.

In order to elucidate the nature of the superconducting state we have performed a low-energy \u03bcSR study. By applying a magnetic field parallel (Meissner state) and perpendicular (vortex state) to the film planes, we could show that superconductivity is sheet like, resulting in a very anisotropic superconducting state. This result is consistent with a simple charge-transfer model, which takes into account the layered structure and the difference in the chemical potential between LCO and LSCO, as well as Sr interdiffusion. Using a pancake-vortex model we could estimate a strict upper limit of the London penetration depth to 380nm in these superlattices.

Indeed, the majority of the chemical elements, excluding noble gases and actinides, have been reported to substitute to some extent into the YBCO structure. This review covers the literature on such substitutions and their effect on the properties of YBCO. Reported solubility limits are given, together with crystal symmetry and trends in unit cell parameters with dopant concentration. The dopant site is considered; this is additionally complex in the case of copper substitution because of the two distinct copper sites in the crystal structure. The effect of the dopant on the critical temperature, T c, is reviewed; the literature is often contradictory due to the dual effects of variable oxygen content and the nature of the dopant. Preparation methods appear to have an effect on solubility limits, crystal symmetry and T c, Also, the methods used to determine solubility limits are often imprecise which can lead to contradictions. The magnetic properties of doped materials are reviewed; for some dopants, particularly the magnetic lanthanides, antiferromagnetism and superconductivity co-exist. The related RBa2Cu3O\u03b4 phases (R = lanthanide), their structure, properties and behaviour on doping are reviewed in a similar way. For the larger rare earths, the related systems R1+x Ba2-x CU3O\u03b4, are reviewed; as x increases, the transition temperature decreases and compositions R1.5Ba1.5Cu3O\u03b4 are semiconducting.

Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) along with T c values of the above crystals, shows that, with BaF2 introduced as additive, the contamination due to aluminium is significantly reduced, which improves crystal growth and superconductivity. The crystals have been subjected to high resolution imaging of planes and chains using STM, while the ensuing changes in the conductance spectra of chains due to Al contamination were studied by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS).

Together with industrial usefulness, some representatives of this large group manifest the ability of superconducting state occurrence. Above factors complemented with still unexplained coupling mechanism lead to the necessity of extensive investigations on MAX phases on this field. The subject of this research is focused on the thermodynamic properties of superconducting state of Nb2InC. Using the strong-coupling Eliashberg theory of superconductivity the values of the superconducting critical temperature (T c ) have been attained together with the order parameter function (\u0394), the thermodynamic critical field (H c ) and the specific heat jump (\u0394C) at the transition temperature for the range of tension applied to bulk material. Interesting results of strain strongly affecting the thermodynamic properties of superconducting state can be highlighted. Major enrichment has been obtained for the most extreme strain values with best improvement in case of the compressed system. Moreover, significant changes of critical temperature are noticeable with the constrict strain increment (from \u2212 4 % to \u2212 8 % ) which results in great development of transition temperature from roughly 0 K to about 35 K, respectively.

In this paper, the impact of the relative rate of applied field dba /dt on both radial and hoop stresses in a long cylindrical superconductor is discussed by solving the Kim model with viscous flux flow. Two magnetization processes are considered during the applied field decreasing: zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The radial and hoop stresses increase with increasing dba /dt in ZFC and the maximum radial and hoop stresses are equal and appear at a plateau region by same dba /dt in FC. In ZFC, two cases are considered: Ba > B* and Ba \u2264 B*, where Ba is the applied field and B* is the magnetic field where all the body forces point away. When Ba > B*, the flux front r 0 is away from the center of the cylinder with increasing dba /dt. However, when Ba \u2264 B*, r 0 is always at the center with different dba /dt. By discussing the parameter of dba /dt, we find the influence of dba /dt on both radial and hoop stresses is appreciable, which can be distinguished from previous works that have discussed the effect of viscous flux flow velocity (\u03c50) on the radial and hoop stresses by Bean model with viscous flux flow equation.

For the observation of such effects, fluctuation induced conductivity (FIC) analyses of the above mentioned samples have been carried out using the Aslamazov\u2013Larkin (AL) theory in the critical regime closer to the transition temperature (T c) and the Lawrence\u2013Doniach (LD) model closer to T c and above. The idea behind these analyses is the fact that Cooper pair formation starts well above T c. The influence of the Cooper-pairs on the normal electrons is determined by the Maki-Thompson (MT) model. From these analyses we have determined the coherence length along the c-axis (\u03be c(0)), the inter-plane coupling constant (J), the phase relaxation time of the carriers (\u03c4\u03c6 ), the Fermi velocity (V F) of the carriers and the energy required to break apart the electrons pairs (E pb). Using the Ginzburg number (N G) and the Ginzburg\u2013Landau (GL) equations, the thermodynamic critical magnetic field (B c(0)), the lower critical field (B c1(0)), the upper critical field (B c2(0)), the critical current density (J c(0)) and the penetration depth (\u03bb p.d) are also calculated. Four fluctuation regions above T c are observed for all of the samples, namely the critical (cr), three dimensional (3D), two dimensional (2D) and zero dimensional (0D) fluctuation regions. The values of B c(0), B c1(0) and J c(0) are increased while the values of E and \u03bb p.d are suppressed with increasing Zn content at Cu sites. The intersection of 2D LD, and 0D exponents determines a cross-over of 2D LD & MT contributions. Associated with the width of 3D AL/LD regimes, the crossover temperature T 3D-2D is shifted to higher values with enhanced Zn doping. It is most likely that decreased density of small spins of Cu atoms induced by increased Zn doping, may suppress the spin scatterings that consequently result in higher values of T 3D-2D, critical fields (B c(0), B c1(0)), J c(0) and lower values of E pb and \u03bb p.d in the final compound.

At low doping levels, the Li shows a strong preference for the chain Cu(1) sites; but at higher levels, this preference shifts to the plane Cu(2) sites. This behavior suggests that the solubility of Li in the chain sites is only about 5%, and that increasing the dopant level above this amount then forces the excess Li into the plane sites. The preferential doping of Li, first into the chain sites and then into the plane sites, provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of hole doping into the CuO2 planes, the role played by the Cu(1)-O(1) charge reservoir, and the O(4) ions that couple it to the planes.

On the other hand, the presence of residual Mg can make the sintering microstructure more homogeneous and dense, and also reduce lattice defects and mechanical strains. All the factors are contributed to the improvement of the grain connectivity in the samples with excess Mg addition sintered at low temperature compared to the reference MgB2 sample sintered at high temperature.

The stable state of materials is determined by the Gibbs energy, which includes both enthalpy and the entropy terms. This means that the knowledge of entropy , which is a measure of the disorder in the material, is essential to understand the thermodynamic properties at finite temperature. The heat capacity measurement is the only way to determine the entropy, and the importance of the measurements was demonstrated by the studies of relaxor behavior in Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN), Pb(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O3 (PMT), and Pb(Sc1/2Ta1/2)O3 (PST). In the relaxors with perovskite structure, a broad heat capacity anomaly was observed around room temperature. The excess heat capacity was caused by the formation and growth of ferroelectric nanoregion in relaxors. The entropy change due to the formation of the nanoregion is limited to only one fifth of the perfect ferroelectric ordering in the materials. It indicates that the disorder remains and freezes at the lower temperature. Such information can be obtained only by the heat capacity measurements, and the usefulness of the thermodynamic study was clearly shown. In the second example, the giant particle size effect on the phase transition in dielectric materials was discussed from the thermodynamic point of view. In general, the particle-size effects on ceramics can be analyzed in terms of the influence of the surface. The relative population of the atom near surface increases gradually with decreasing the particle size, and the surface effect becomes considerable only in nanometer scale. However, the peculiar particle-size effect on the phase transition was found in some dielectric substances BaZnGeO4(BZG) and CsZnPO4 (CZP), in which the critical size for the phase transition locates around 1 mm. The sample with large size above 1 mm showed a heat capacity anomaly due to the phase transition, but no heat capacity anomaly was observed in the small samples. In addition to the appearance and disappearance of the phase transition, the phase transition observed in large crystals showed a kinetic behavior. The heat capacity anomaly grew with increasing the annealing time just below the phase transition temperature. The kinetics of the growth of the heat capacity anomaly was analyzed using Avrami model, and the results indicated a heterogeneous nucleation and growth mechanism. The mechanism of this curious giant particle size effect of the phase transition have not been understand clearly yet. However, the high-temperature phase is ferroelastic in both materials, and the ferroelastic domain may influence the phase transition property. It became clear that all the possible types of thermal agitation contribute to the heat capacity of materials, and thus, the heat capacity measurements have an advantage to find novel phenomena occurring with the temperature change.

The presence of Ag as an additive in FePt\u2013Ag nanocomposite, increases the magnetic coercivity. This nanocomposite, with 10% Ag, was deposited by magnetron sputtering on the MgO heat layer. VSM results of 10 nm nanoparticles show that coercivity has increased up to 1.4 T.

Ag gradually form nano scale clusters with separate lattice and FePt\u2013Ag nanocomposite appears. The result of this process is emptiness of Ag position in FePt-fcc lattice.

The experiment results reveal that all the samples doped are composed of Bi-2212 phase and traces of Bi-2201 secondary phase when compared to the undoped sample. The refinement of cell parameters shows that the doping reduces the cell volume of the samples. The texture degree decreases with doping while the degree of orthorhombicity increases. Quantitative EDS analysis confirms that Gd atoms are successfully introduced into crystalline structure. The SEM micrographs show randomly distributed grains with a flake-like shape. The highest value of onset critical transition temperatures is obtained for x=0.10 and is about 90.22K, which correlates well with the observed slope of resistivity and the hole concentration of the CuO2 layers.

Static stripes detected as extra peaks in diffraction patterns, appear in a number of oxide perovskites as well as some other systems. The more controversial dynamic stripes, which are not detectable by diffraction, may be universally present in copper oxide superconductors. Thus it is important to learn how to detect dynamic stripes as well as to understand their influence on electronic properties. This review article focuses on lattice vibrations (phonons) that might show signatures of the charge component of dynamic stripes. The first part of the article describes recent progress in learning about how the phonon signatures of different types of electronic charge fluctuations including stripes can be distinguished from purely structural instabilities and from each other. Then I will focus on the evidence for dynamic stripes in the phonon spectra of copper oxide superconductors.", "t_type_dict": {"T2": "Property", "T3": "Property", "T5": "Property", "T6": "Property", "T7": "Property", "T9": "Property", "T10": "Element", "T12": "Material", "T13": "Element", "T14": "SC", "T15": "Property", "T16": "Material", "T17": "Property", "T18": "Property", "T19": "Property", "T20": "Property", "T21": "Property", "T25": "Property", "T26": "Element", "T27": "SC", "T11": "Material", "T22": "Property", "T4": "Doping", "T1": "Property"}, "t_span_dict": {"T2": [19, 28], "T3": [69, 75], "T5": [106, 117], "T6": [173, 187], "T7": [191, 196], "T9": [208, 222], "T10": [310, 315], "T12": [316, 327], "T13": [470, 482], "T14": [483, 498], "T15": [604, 625], "T16": [658, 665], "T17": [666, 676], "T18": [678, 685], "T19": [721, 727], "T20": [840, 846], "T21": [880, 897], "T25": [1069, 1075], "T26": [1087, 1099], "T27": [1100, 1115], "T11": [962, 986], "T22": [85, 105], "T4": [202, 207], "T1": [0, 12]}, "r_type_dict": {}, "r_args_dict": {}, "e_type_dict": {"E1": "Doping"}, "e_trig_dict": {"E1": "T4"}, "e_args_dict": {"E1": [["Dopant", "T7"]]}}], "t_type_set": ["Material", "Doping", "SC", "Value", "Process", "Characterization", "Element", "Property", "Main"], "r_type_set": ["Target", "Condition", "Equivalent"], "e_type_set": ["Doping"], "e_role_set": ["Site", "Dopant"]}
